    "# A Developer's Guide to Model Onboarding in AIOS\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this guide on onboarding a model to the OpenOS/AIGr.id platform. This notebook serves as a standalone tutorial that walks you through every step of the process, from registering your model as a digital asset to running inference and managing its lifecycle. We will use the `deepseek_r1_distill_70b` model as our primary example.\n",

    "## The AIOS Ecosystem: A Brief Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, it's helpful to understand the key components of the AIOS ecosystem. AIOS is designed as a decentralized, modular, and extensible platform for AI development and deployment. Its architecture consists of several core services that work together to manage the lifecycle of AI models and applications. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asset DB Registry**: A central catalog for discovering and managing versioned, runnable software components (Assets).\n",
    "- **Resource Allocator**: Responsible for scheduling and allocating resources for running Assets on the network of clusters.\n",
    "- **Block Controller**: Manages the lifecycle of a Block, which is a running instance of an Asset.\n",
    "- **Metrics System**: A comprehensive system for monitoring the health, status, and performance of Blocks.\n",
    "- [AIOS Ecosystem Architecture](https://docs.aigr.id/assets/aios-all-arch.drawio.png)\n",

    "## Onboarding Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will cover the following steps in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Registering an Asset**: We will create a `component.json` file that describes our model and register it with the AIOS Component Registry.\n",
    "2. **Allocating a Block**: We will define the block's configuration in an `allocation.json` file and allocate a block using the AIOS API.\n",
    "3. **Checking Block Status & Metrics**: We will use `curl` commands to check the block's status, health, and metrics.\n",
    "4. **Performing Inference**: We will write a Python script to send an inference request to the block via gRPC.\n",
    "5. **Chat UI with streaming**: We will launch an interactive chat interface to demonstrate streaming capabilities.\n",
    "6. **Cleaning Up**: We will deallocate the block and deregister the asset when done.\n",
