    "\n",
    "1.  **Basic Health Checks**: How to use the AIOS API to perform basic health checks on your blocks.\n",
    "2.  **Interpreting Health Status**: Understanding the JSON response from the health check API.\n",
    "3.  **Custom Health Check Policies**: A step-by-step guide to creating your own custom health check policies for more advanced monitoring scenarios."

    "    -   **`healthy`**: A boolean value indicating the health of the specific instance.\n",

    "    -   **`reason`** or **`lastMetrics`**: Provides additional context about the instance's status.\n",
