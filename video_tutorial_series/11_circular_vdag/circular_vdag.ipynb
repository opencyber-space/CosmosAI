    "# Circular vDAG Tutorial: A Deep Dive into AIOSv1 Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This tutorial demonstrates how to build and run a sophisticated, circular vDAG using AIOSv1. We'll construct a multi-turn debate system featuring two debaters (A and B) and a judge. By the end of this video, you'll be able to build your own self-correcting, debating, or collaborative systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this tutorial, your take away will be:**\n",
    "- How to implement a circular workflow using post-processing routing policies.\n",
    "- How to use a pre-processing policy to create and inject a \"running summary\" for long-term context.\n",
    "- How to deploy and manage the vDAG on a Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This directory contains local copies of all the policy and model inference code, and the vDAG itself is defined inline, making this a self-contained example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Overview\n",
    "1.  **What are Policies and Blocks in AIOSv1?**: Understand the core components that separate logic from inference.\n",
    "2.  **Implementation Deep Dive**: See the high-level architecture of our three-agent debate system.\n",
    "3.  **Code and Policies: A Closer Look**: Examine the local Python scripts that define our agent behaviors.\n",

    "A policy is a dynamically loadable, executable Python code that is used in various places and use cases across the AIOS system. Since policies are dynamic, they allow developers to implement custom functionalities throughout the AIOS system. Below are some examples of polices used in AIOS that are relevant for this tutorial as well.\n",
    "- **Preprocessing Policies**: Modify incoming requests. In this tutorial, we use one to manage a conversation summary.\n",

    "Block the core component AIOSv1 responsible for instantiating, serving, scaling and managing the AI inference or any general computational workload defined using AIOSv1 Instance SDK. In this tutorial, a \"block\" is the core component that executes your model code(e.g., running a Llama.cpp model) and has several policies associated with it. It is intentionally kept simple and focused on inference. The complex logic is offloaded to the policies that wrap it. A `block` can be composed of below policies apart from the other policies in the link below:\n",
    "1.  **Preprocessing Policy (Optional)**: Acts on the request before it hits your model.\n",
    "2.  **Inference Code**: The actual model execution.\n",

    "### 2. Implementation Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a high-level overview of the components in our circular debate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing (Summarizer Policy)**\n",
    "  - Builds a per-session `recent_turns` window, summarizing the conversation periodically.\n",
    "  - This summary is then injected back into the prompt, giving the models long-term context.\n",
    "  - The summarization has its own knobs, like cadence (`summarize_every_n_messages`) and token thresholds (`min_tokens_for_summarization`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debater Inference Code (`main_debate_simple.py`)**\n",
    "  - A simple inference wrapper with a fixed role (A or B) using AIOSv1's LLM SDK\n",
    "  - It constructs a prompt from the topic and the opponent's last turn.\n",
    "  - If a `running_summary` is available (from the preprocessor), it's injected as a system message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debater Postprocessing (Router Policy)**\n",
    "  - This is where the core routing logic lives.\n",
    "  - It decides whether to send the response to the opponent or escalate to the judge based on a set of rules.\n",
    "  - For example, it uses `judge_interval_rounds` to escalate the debate to the judge every N rounds for a periodic review. It also uses `max_consec_by_same_role` as a safeguard to prevent one debater from dominating the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Judge Inference Code (`main_judge_capped.py`)**\n",
    "  - Builds a prompt for the judge using the topic and the full recent history.\n",
    "  - The judge's job is to assess the state of the debate and decide whether it should continue or end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Judge Postprocessing (Router Policy)**\n",
    "  - Parses the judge's decision from the model's output. A `CONTINUE` decision routes the conversation back to one of the debaters, maintaining the circular flow. A `FINAL_JUDGMENT` decision terminates the vDAG execution.\n",
    "  - It also enforces global caps like `max_rounds` to ensure the debate eventually concludes, preventing infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stopping Conditions**\n",
    "  - The debate ends when the Judge returns `FINAL_JUDGMENT` or when a hard cap (like `max_rounds`) is reached."

    "#### A Note on the Inference Code and Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand how the inference code and policies collaborate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference Code:** The Python scripts (`main_debate_simple.py` and `main_judge_capped.py`) are intentionally minimal. Their main job is to:\n",
    "1. Receive a request.\n",
    "2. Format a prompt based on the input data.\n",
    "3. Call the LLM for inference.\n",
    "4. Return the raw output.\n",
    "\n",
    "They use specific system messages to guide the behavior of the models:\n",
    "- **Judge System Message**: \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  You are an impartial debate judge. You will be given TOPIC, ROUNDS, and the latest turns from A and B. Decide strictly by clarity, relevance to the topic/instruction, coherence, and factual plausibility. Return exactly: DECISION: CONTINUE_A|CONTINUE_B|FINAL_JUDGMENT If FINAL_JUDGMENT, also return:  WINNER: A|B|DRAW  REASON: <very short reason>  Output only the specified fields with no extra text.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Debater System Message**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  You are a debate participant debater-A or role A in a router-orchestrated exchange. Provide a concise, on-topic argument that advances your side, directly addressing the latest message and also based on your past arguments. Do not declare a winner, do not judge, and do not ask who speaks next. Be specific, factual where possible, and avoid meta-comments or system/control tokens. Keep the response short and self-contained in 100 words.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policies Calling LLMs:** Policies can also execute their own inference calls. For instance, the **preprocessing summarizer** needs to can call an LLM to generate a summary. This is typically done by using a utility client within the policy code to call an \"external\" LLM service. This \"external\" service could even be another AIOS Block optimized for summarization. This powerful feature allows you to build complex, multi-model workflows where policies act as intelligent agents, preparing and routing data between different specialized models. One can even use the same models for summarization and review via rest or grpc calls."

    "The behavior of the debate is controlled by parameters compiled into the policies. You can adjust these to change the dynamics of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing Summarizer (`preprocessing_policy_for_summarization:0.0.1-stable`)**\n",
    "  - `summarize_every_n_messages` (default 3): Controls the frequency of summarization. A lower number means more frequent summaries, which provides better context but increases computational overhead.\n",
    "  - `history_max_messages` (default 3): Defines the size of the sliding window of conversation turns used for the summary. A larger window provides more context to the summarizer model.\n",
    "  - `min_tokens_for_summarization` (default 300): A gate to prevent summarizing very short exchanges, saving resources.\n",
    "  - `include_last_summary_in_prompt` (true): Enables chained summaries, where the previous summary is included in the prompt for the next one, creating a continuous thread of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debater Router (`postprocessing_policy_router_debater:0.0.1-stable`)**\n",
    "  - `review_threshold` (default 0.5): An optional quality gate. If the model output includes a confidence score, the router can use this threshold to decide whether to accept the response or retry. (Note: This is not used in the current simple debater).\n",
    "  - `judge_interval_rounds` (default 4): Sets the cadence for periodic review by the judge. After this many rounds, the debate is automatically escalated to the judge.\n",
    "  - `max_consec_by_same_role` (default 3): A safety measure to prevent one debater from making multiple consecutive arguments, ensuring a balanced conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Judge Router (`postprocessing_policy_router_judge:0.0.1-stable`)**\n",
    "  - `max_rounds` (default 20): A hard cap on the total number of rounds in the debate. This acts as a failsafe to prevent infinite loops and control costs.\n",
    "  - `judge_continue_cap` (default 5): Limits the number of times the judge can return a `CONTINUE` decision. After this cap is reached, the judge is forced to make a `FINAL_JUDGMENT`, ensuring the debate concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Watch the pod logs to see the exact prompts being constructed, especially when summaries are used."

      "{'data': {'bump_round': True, 'judge_text': \"Alright, so I'm trying to design an end-to-end real-time computer vision pipeline for detecting loitering and chain-snatching incidents using urban CCTV cameras. The constraints are pretty tight: 1080p resolution at 15â€“25 FPS, maximum alert latency of 300 ms, and a high recall rate of at least 90% with a low false positive rate (FPPI â‰¤0.1/hr/camera). Plus, I have to handle 200 cameras on a mix of Jetson Orin and T4 edge nodes, which means I need to be mindful of computational resources and potential connectivity issues.\\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the problem into manageable components. The pipeline should include detection of persons, riders, and hand-object interactions, multi-object tracking (MOT) with re-identification (re-ID), dwell-time estimation, action recognition, geo-fencing, and alerting. Each of these components will require careful selection of models and algorithms to meet the performance and latency constraints.\\n\\nFor detection, I'm considering models like RT-DETR and YOLOv8. RT-DETR is known for its accuracy, especially in detecting small objects, which is crucial for identifying something like a chain being snatched. However, YOLOv8 might offer better speed, which is essential for real-time processing. I need to weigh the trade-offs between accuracy and speed here.\\n\\nNext, for MOT, options like ByteTrack and OC-SORT come to mind. ByteTrack is lightweight and efficient, which is great for edge devices, but OC-SORT might handle crowded scenes better, which is common in urban areas. I need to think about which is more critical: handling crowds or keeping the computational load low.\\n\\nRe-ID is another important aspect. FastReID is a solid choice, but I might need a lightweight version to ensure it doesn't bog down the system. Maybe a distilled version could maintain accuracy while reducing computational demands.\\n\\nDwell-time estimation can be approached with a Kalman filter or a Gaussian process. Kalman filters are computationally efficient, which is a plus for edge devices, but Gaussian processes might offer better accuracy, which could be critical for correctly identifying loitering behavior.\\n\\nAction recognition is where I'm a bit stuck. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) could model complex interactions between objects, which might be beneficial for understanding the dynamics of a chain-snatching incident. On the other hand, a lightweight 3D CNN could process spatial and temporal features simultaneously, which is advantageous for real-time action recognition.\\n\\nGeo-fencing and alerting need to be integrated seamlessly. I should consider how to define geo-fences and ensure that alerts are generated and transmitted efficiently, especially with intermittent connectivity.\\n\\nRobustness is a big concern. The system needs to handle various environmental conditions like night, rain, and occlusions. Techniques like data augmentation, hard-negative mining, domain adaptation, and adversarial training could help improve robustness. Privacy is another aspect; on-device blurring or redaction will be necessary to protect individuals' privacy.\\n\\nMonitoring for drift and bias is essential. I need to implement checks to ensure the system doesn't develop biases over time and that its performance doesn't degrade due to concept drift. A/B testing could help compare different model configurations and ensure the system remains accurate and reliable.\\n\\nIn terms of evaluation, I'll need to use metrics like mAP, IDF1, FPPI, and E2E latency to assess the system's performance comprehensively. Synthetic stress tests simulating night, rain, and crowded conditions will help validate the system's robustness in challenging scenarios.\\n\\nThe rollout strategy should be phased, starting with a small-scale deployment to test the system in real-world conditions before scaling up to all 200 cameras. This approach will help identify and address any issues early on.\\n\\nOverall, I'm leaning towards using YOLOv8 for detection due to its speed-accuracy balance, OC-SORT for MOT in crowded areas, a lightweight 3D CNN for action recognition to handle real-time processing, and a Kalman filter for dwell-time estimation to keep things efficient on edge devices. I'll also prioritize domain adaptation and adversarial training for robustness and ensure privacy measures are in place. The evaluation plan will focus on both accuracy and latency metrics, with thorough stress testing to ensure reliability under various conditions.\\n</think>\\n\\nDECISION: FINAL_JUDGMENT  \\nWINNER: B  \\nREASON: B's pipeline offers a better balance of speed and accuracy, crucial for real-time processing, with efficient models like YOLOv8 and OC-SORT, and robust techniques for action recognition and dwell-time estimation.\", 'opponent_last': '', 'router_meta': {'recent_turns': [{'reply': 'I propose a multi-stage chain-snatching action recognition system from traffic CCTV footage.
