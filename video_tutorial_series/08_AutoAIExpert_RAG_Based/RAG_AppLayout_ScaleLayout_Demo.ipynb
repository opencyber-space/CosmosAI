    "## 🎯 Scope of AppLayout and ScaleLayout Automation\n",
    "- Traditionally, the creation higher level AI or ensemble AI meant handcrafting the ensembles and large high skills teams to meticulously plan, operate and mange deployments - a completely manual process - that doesnt scale. AppLayouts and ScaleLayouts allowed automation of most parts of the process - making it scalable and efficient. What about automating the app layout and scale layout itself 100%, that puts us in the territory of skynet - an AI that can compose itself and scale and adapt infintely to available resources. \n",
    "- Without autoAI \n",
    "  - It would require a domain expert to first architect the application's logical blueprint and then devise an end to end optimal deployment strategy - simpler for small scale and beyond complexity for large to planetary scale. \n",
    "  - These plans would then be handed off to the AIOS for execution. \n",
    "- In this demonstration, we unveil a revolutionary shift. \n",
    "  - We will showcase how an expert system powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system can completely automate this workflow, dynamically generating and deploying the entire application structure in direct response to a user's query. \n",
