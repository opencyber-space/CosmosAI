# usecase-frames

This table provides observed CPU and memory usage for the `usecase-frames` block at various event rates.  
**Important:**  Use this file's data when estimating Scalelayout for CPU and RAM estimation for given `eventsReceivedPerTick(60seconds)` for the `usecase-frames` block not for any other block.
