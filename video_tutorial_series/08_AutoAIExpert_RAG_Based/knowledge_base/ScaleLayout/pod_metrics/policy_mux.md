# policy_mux

This table provides observed CPU and memory usage for the `policy_mux` block at various event rates.
**Important:**  Use this file's data when estimating Scalelayout for CPU and RAM estimation for given `eventsReceivedPerTick(60seconds)` for the `policy_mux` block not for any other block.
