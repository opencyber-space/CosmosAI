      {
        "principle": "Start with simpler models",
        "explanation": "Begin with lightweight models and only increase complexity if performance requirements aren't met. Simpler models are easier to deploy, debug, and often provide adequate performance for many use cases."
      },
      {
        "principle": "Consider end-to-end latency",
        "explanation": "The entire pipeline's latency is more important than individual component speed. A faster detector with a slower tracker might have worse overall performance than a slightly slower detector with an efficient tracker."
      },
      {
        "principle": "Match resolutions across components",
        "explanation": "Ensure consistent resolution handling across pipeline components to prevent unnecessary resizing operations which can degrade both performance and accuracy."
      },
      {
        "principle": "Test with representative data",
        "explanation": "Always validate pipelines with data that closely resembles the target deployment environment, including lighting conditions, camera angles, and object densities."
