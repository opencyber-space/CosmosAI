This document describes a FaceNet-based face recognition and embedding extraction component (facenet v0.0.1) for re-identification tasks.  It uses an InceptionResNetV1 backbone, producing 512-dimensional embeddings, and employs a Euclidean distance metric with triplet loss.  Trained on a combined dataset (VGGFace2, MS-Celeb-1M, and a custom dataset) for diverse scenarios, it achieves high accuracy (around 99.5% or higher for verification and identification).  The component requires a GPU (NVIDIA T4 recommended) and supports batching (batch size 8 default). Key parameters include a distance threshold (default 0.6) and input size (default 160x160).  The component consumes face crops or RGB images and produces face embeddings, identities, and similarity scores.  It's optimized for surveillance and access control, supporting both 1:1 and 1:N matching.
