This document describes a GPU-requiring object tracking algorithm component named "trackerlitefast" (v0.0.1, stable).  It uses the "fastskiptrackerallres:latest" container image and supports batching up to a size of 8.  The tracker requires frames of 1920x1080 and offers configurable settings and parameters for tracking behavior, including object type, age penalties, motion weight, cost thresholds (association, re-identification), IOU, duplicate, occlusion, and confidence thresholds, confirmation hits, history size, and detector skip frames.  It also allows selection of decoder and interpolation types. Developed by "poc" (poc@ai.org), this closed-source component is based on the FastMOT Multi-Object Tracker (PyTorch framework) and is tagged for "alert" functionalities.  Input and output are handled via "input_0" and "output_0" respectively.  The model has 2.1 million parameters and uses a ResNet backbone (partially truncated in the provided text).
