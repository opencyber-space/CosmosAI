The YOLOv3 Vehicles5 model is a PyTorch-based object detection model designed for surveillance applications.  It uses a Darknet-53 backbone and FPN neck to detect five vehicle classes (car, bus, truck, motorbike, and autorickshaw) in 416x416 RGB images.  Trained on a custom dataset and optimized for surveillance scenarios, it achieves up to 129 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 with a batch size of 16, though it has higher memory usage than newer models.  Key features include closed-source licensing, OD1 input/output format, and Dockerized deployment.  The model is suitable for traffic surveillance, parking management, security systems, and smart city infrastructure.  Performance benchmarks with varying batch sizes are provided, showing a balance between speed and memory usage.  Integration guidelines specify input/output data formats and API details.
