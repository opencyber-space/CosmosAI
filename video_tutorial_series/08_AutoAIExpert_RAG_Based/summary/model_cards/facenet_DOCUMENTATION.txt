The FaceNet face recognition model (v0.0.1) uses an InceptionResNetV1 architecture and triplet loss to generate 512-dimensional face embeddings for 1:1 verification and 1:N identification with 99.65% accuracy.  It requires a GPU (NVIDIA recommended), uses TensorFlow 2.8, and accepts 160x160 RGB face crops as input.  Key features include batch processing (up to 32 faces), configurable distance threshold, and FP16 precision for faster inference.  Performance benchmarks on an NVIDIA T4 show up to 220 FPS with a batch size of 32.  The model outputs embeddings, similarity scores, and identity predictions in OD1 format.  Limitations include sensitivity to small face sizes, extreme poses, occlusions, and age changes.  Security and privacy considerations regarding biometric data are emphasized.  A typical pipeline integrates FaceNet between face alignment and identity matching.
