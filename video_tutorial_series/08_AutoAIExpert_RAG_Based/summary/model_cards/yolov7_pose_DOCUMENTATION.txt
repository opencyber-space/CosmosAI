The YOLOv7 Pose Estimation model (v0.0.1) detects people and estimates their poses (17 COCO keypoints) using an E-ELAN backbone and FPN-PANet neck.  Achieving 68% AP and 85% keypoint accuracy at 33.3 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, it's designed for real-time surveillance applications.  Key features include configurable input resolution (optimized for 576x960), batch processing (up to 8 images), and FP16 precision for faster inference.  The model uses PyTorch, requires CUDA 11.0+, and outputs person bounding boxes, keypoint coordinates, and confidence scores in OD1 format.  Performance benchmarks demonstrate its suitability for real-time monitoring and batch processing scenarios.  The documentation also details hardware requirements, runtime environment, configuration parameters (confidence threshold, NMS IoU threshold, resolution settings, performance settings, and advanced settings), and the input/output data contract.
