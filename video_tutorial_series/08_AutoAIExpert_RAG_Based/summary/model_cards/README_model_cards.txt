This directory contains JSON model cards documenting AI/ML models used in computer vision pipelines.  Each card uniquely identifies a model (`componentId`) and specifies its type (`componentType`), Docker image (`containerImage`), hardware requirements (`requiresGPU`), and detailed configuration (`componentConfig`).  Cards are structured with sections detailing identity/metadata, hardware requirements, input/output data formats, configurable parameters, performance characteristics, and model-specific information like architecture and training data.
