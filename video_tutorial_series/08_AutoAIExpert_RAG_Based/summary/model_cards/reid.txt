This document describes a person re-identification (ReID) algorithm component named "reidbaseline" (v0.0.1).  It's a GPU-requiring PyTorch model designed to extract features from person crops, optimized for multi-camera tracking.  Key features include batching support (up to size 8), configurable settings like FP16 usage and decoder type, and an input resolution of 1920x1080.  Trained on a combination of public and custom datasets, it achieves a Rank-1 accuracy of 88.7% on Market-1501.  The model requires a minimum of 3GB GPU memory and is best suited for NVIDIA T4 GPUs.  It consumes person crops and bounding boxes, producing person features, similarity scores, and ReID embeddings.  The component is documented with metadata including author information, licensing, and relevant links to research papers and internal benchmarks.
