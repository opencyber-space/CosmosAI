This document describes a YOLOv3-based vehicle detection component (vehicles5, v0.0.1) trained on a custom dataset to detect five vehicle types (car, bus, truck, motorbike, and autorickshaw).  It uses a Darknet-53 backbone, FPN neck, and YOLOv3 head, requiring a GPU (preferably an NVIDIA T4 with at least 2GB memory) and a specified runtime environment.  Benchmarks on an NVIDIA T4 show optimal performance at a batch size of 16, achieving 129 FPS, while a batch size of 8 offers better efficiency.  The component consumes RGB frames and produces vehicle bounding boxes and classifications, using the OD1 format for both input and output.  It's presented as a closed-source solution with code presumably hosted on a private GitHub repository.
