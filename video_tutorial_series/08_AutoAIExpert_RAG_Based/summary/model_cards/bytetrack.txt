This document describes a ByteTrack multi-object tracker component (v0.0.1) for real-time tracking, using a ResNet50 backbone and ByteTrack algorithm with Kalman filter and IoU + Re-ID association.  It requires a GPU (preferably NVIDIA T4 with 3GB memory) and supports batching (batch size 4) for 1920x1080 frames. Key parameters include track threshold, track buffer, and match threshold.  It's pretrained on MOT17, MOT20, and custom data, achieving a MOTA of 0.763 and MOTP of 0.85.  Throughput ranges from 28 FPS (1080p crowd) to 50 FPS (720p general).  The component consumes OD1 format detection lists and RGB frames, producing OD1 format lists and tracking metadata.  It's authored by "poc" and licensed as "closed".
