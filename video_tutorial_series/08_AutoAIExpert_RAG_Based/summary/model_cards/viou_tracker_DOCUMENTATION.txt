V-IOU Tracker Lite (v0.0.1) is a lightweight, OpenCV-based multi-object tracker designed for resource-constrained environments.  It uses a combination of Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and visual cues (KCF or MEDIANFLOW, optionally none) to achieve a balance between efficiency and accuracy.  On an NVIDIA T4 GPU, it achieves 68% MOTA at 60 FPS for 1080p video, utilizing only 25% GPU and minimal memory.  Key parameters include IoU and height similarity thresholds, minimum track length, and tracker type.  The tracker requires minimal hardware (2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, 1GB GPU memory with CUDA 11.0+) and runs on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8+. It accepts OD1 format detection data and RGB frames as input, outputting tracked objects with IDs, bounding boxes, and metadata in the same OD1 format.  Performance benchmarks show decent throughput and tracking quality metrics across various resolutions.
