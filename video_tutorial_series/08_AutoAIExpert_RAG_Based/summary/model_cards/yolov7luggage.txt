This document describes a GPU-accelerated YOLOv7-based luggage detection algorithm packaged as a Docker container (luggagedetection:latest).  It's designed for surveillance scenarios, detecting objects like suitcases, backpacks, bags, and general luggage. Key features include batching support (up to size 8), configurable confidence and NMS thresholds, and various performance settings (FP16, CUDA, decoder type).  The model, trained on a custom dataset, achieves a mAP@.50 of 0.82 with a throughput up to 140 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 (batch size 8).  It requires a minimum of 4GB GPU memory and consumes RGB frames, producing bounding boxes and classifications in the OD1 format.  The component is considered stable (v0.0.1) and is licensed as closed source.
