The document describes a lightweight V-IOU tracker component (trackerlite v0.0.1) for multi-object tracking using intersection-over-union metrics.  It's a GPU-requiring node algorithm packaged in a Docker container (vioutrackerdocker:latest). Key features include batching support (size 4), configurable settings like tracker type (KCF, MEDIANFLOW, NONE), decoder type (DALI, TURBO), and interpolation method.  It consumes and produces OD1 format data, requiring RGB frames and OD1 lists as input.  Performance benchmarks on an NVIDIA T4 show a MOTA of 0.68, MOTP of 0.76, and throughput up to 120 FPS at 480p. The tracker is a non-learning, rule-based algorithm using geometric and visual cues, written in OpenCV and designed for lightweight, embedded scenarios.  It's closed source, authored by "poc," and further details can be found on a specified GitHub repository and an arXiv paper on V-IOU similarity measures.
