The YOLOv7 Vehicles5 model is a PyTorch-based object detection model designed for surveillance applications, specializing in detecting five vehicle types: cars, buses, trucks, motorbikes, and autorickshaws.  It uses an E-ELAN backbone, FPN-PANet neck, and YOLOv7 detection head, with 37.2M parameters and 9 optimized anchor boxes.  The model accepts input resolutions from 416x416 to 1280x1280 (default 640x640) and supports batch processing.  Key configuration parameters include confidence and NMS IoU thresholds, input dimensions, batch size, and FP16 precision usage.  Benchmarks on an NVIDIA T4 show optimal throughput at batch size 16 (161 FPS).  Trained on a custom dataset of surveillance footage, the model is optimized for diverse lighting and traffic conditions.  Target use cases include traffic monitoring, parking management, security surveillance, and toll collection.  The model card also provides example configurations for different scenarios and lists hardware/software requirements.
