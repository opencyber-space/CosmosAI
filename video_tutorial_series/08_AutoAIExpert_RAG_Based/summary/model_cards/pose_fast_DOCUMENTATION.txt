This document describes a real-time pose estimation model (`pose_fast.json`) based on the HRNet-W32 architecture, optimized for speed and accuracy in applications like surveillance and activity recognition.  It uses a PyTorch framework and detects 17 COCO keypoints with configurable model sizes (large, medium, small) impacting the accuracy/speed trade-off.  The model accepts input resolutions from 639x639 to 1280x1280, supports batch processing (1-4 images), and outputs keypoint coordinates, confidence scores, and bounding boxes in OD1 format.  Performance benchmarks on an NVIDIA T4 show up to 45 FPS for single-person pose estimation and utilizes 2.4-4.0GB of GPU memory depending on the configuration.  System requirements include a GPU, Python 3.8+, PyTorch 1.9+, CUDA 11.0+, and Ubuntu 20.04.  The model is trained on COCO, MPII, and a custom dataset for diverse scenarios.  Use cases include surveillance, fitness, healthcare, sports analytics, security, and entertainment, with support for activity recognition like fall detection and gesture recognition.
