This document describes a GPU-accelerated YOLOv7-based object detection component (vehicles5Detection v0.0.1) specifically trained for vehicle detection (car, bus, truck, motorbike, autorickshaw) using a custom dataset.  It utilizes the E-ELAN backbone, FPN-PANet neck, and Detect(V7) head. Key features include batching support (default batch size 8), configurable confidence and NMS thresholds, and various settings for FP16 usage, CUDA usage, image resizing, and decoding methods.  The model requires a GPU (NVIDIA T4 recommended) with at least 2GB memory, 8GB RAM, and runs within a Docker container (vehicles5detection:latest) with a specified software environment. Benchmarks on an NVIDIA T4 show increasing throughput with larger batch sizes up to 16, with corresponding increases in GPU utilization and memory consumption. The component consumes RGB frames (rgb_frames) in OD1 format and produces object detection lists (od1_list) also in OD1 format.
