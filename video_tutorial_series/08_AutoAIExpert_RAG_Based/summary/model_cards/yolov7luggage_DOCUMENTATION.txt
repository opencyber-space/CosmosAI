The YOLOv7 Luggage Detection model (v0.0.1) is a PyTorch-based object detection model designed for real-time luggage identification in security settings.  It uses an E-ELAN backbone, FPN-PANet neck, and YOLOv7 detection head, detecting four luggage categories (suitcase, backpack, bag, luggage) with 82% mAP@0.5 and up to 140 FPS in batch mode.  It requires an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 11.0+ and has configurable input resolutions (416x416 to 1280x1280), batch sizes (1-8), and parameters like confidence and NMS IoU thresholds.  The model outputs bounding boxes, classifications, and confidence scores in OD1 format.  Performance benchmarks on an NVIDIA T4 show increasing throughput with larger batch sizes, with corresponding increases in GPU memory usage.  The documentation also details hardware requirements, runtime environment, configuration parameters, and data contract specifications.
