This document describes a GPU-accelerated YOLOv7-Tiny based vehicle detection component (vehicles5FastDetection v0.0.1) optimized for speed.  It uses a PyTorch model trained on a custom vehicle dataset to detect cars, buses, trucks, motorbikes, and autorickshaws.  Key features include configurable confidence and NMS thresholds, batching support, and FP16 precision.  The container requires an NVIDIA T4 or equivalent GPU with at least 1.5GB memory, 4GB RAM, and runs on Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 11.0, cuDNN 8.0, and Python 3.8.  Benchmarks on an NVIDIA T4 show throughput up to 370 FPS with a batch size of 64. The component consumes RGB frames (rgb_frames) in OD1 format and produces vehicle bounding boxes (vehicle_bboxes) and classifications (vehicle_classifications) also in OD1 format.
