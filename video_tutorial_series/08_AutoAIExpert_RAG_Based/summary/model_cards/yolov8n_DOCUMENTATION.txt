The YOLOv8 Nano model card details a lightweight, real-time object detection model ideal for edge devices.  With 3.2M parameters and 8.7G FLOPs, it achieves a mAP@0.5 of 37.1% on COCO val2017 and processes images at 180+ FPS on an NVIDIA T4.  Key features include a CSPDarknet backbone, SiLU activation, and configurable parameters like confidence threshold, IoU threshold, and maximum detections.  It supports batching, FP16 precision, and DALI decoding for performance optimization.  Trained on COCO 2017, it's suitable for applications like surveillance, automotive, and robotics. System requirements include a GPU, Python 3.8+, PyTorch 1.13+, and CUDA 11.0+.  The document also provides configuration examples for different use cases and integration guidelines for optimal performance.
