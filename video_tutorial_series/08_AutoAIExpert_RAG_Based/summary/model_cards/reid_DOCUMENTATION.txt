This document describes a Person Re-Identification (ReID) baseline model, built on ResNet50 and trained with triplet loss, designed to generate 2048-dimensional feature embeddings for person matching across multiple cameras.  Key features include cosine similarity for matching, support for batch processing, and configurable parameters like batch size, decoder type (DALI/TURBO), and FP16 precision.  Performance benchmarks on Market-1501 show a Rank-1 accuracy of 88.7% and throughput up to 180 FPS on an NVIDIA T4. The model requires a GPU, preferably an NVIDIA T4, and a specific software environment including Python 3.8+, PyTorch 1.9+, and CUDA 11.0+.  Trained on datasets like Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17, it's designed for applications like multi-camera tracking, surveillance, access control, and retail analytics, addressing challenges like cross-camera matching, temporal matching, and viewpoint invariance. The document also provides configuration examples for optimizing speed and accuracy.
