This document describes a general-purpose object detection component named "general7Detection" (v0.0.1), which utilizes a YOLOv7 model trained on the COCO 2017 dataset.  It requires a GPU (recommended NVIDIA RTX 3060 with 6GB memory) and uses a Docker image "generalobjdetection:latest" within a specified runtime environment (Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8, CUDA 11.0, cuDNN 8.0).  The component supports batching (default batch size 8) and processes frames of 1920x1080 resolution.  Configurable parameters include confidence and NMS IOU thresholds, batch size, and usage of FP16 and CUDA.  The model has 37.2M parameters and uses an E-ELAN backbone, FPN-PANet neck, and Detect(V7) head. Benchmarks on an RTX 3060 show throughput up to 90 FPS for batch size 1 and 150 FPS for batch size 4.  The component is authored by "poc" and licensed as "closed".
