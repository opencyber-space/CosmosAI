This document describes the YOLOv8n object detection model, a lightweight, real-time solution optimized for edge devices.  It uses a PyTorch framework and requires a GPU, ideally an NVIDIA T4 with at least 2GB of memory. Key features include a batch size of 16, configurable confidence and IoU thresholds, and FP16 precision support.  Trained on the COCO 2017 dataset, it boasts a mAP@.50 of 0.371 and throughput up to 320 FPS with a batch size of 16 on an NVIDIA T4.  The model consumes RGB frames or images and produces bounding boxes, class IDs, confidence scores, and detection counts.  It's designed for applications like surveillance and automotive, offering a balance between speed and accuracy with only 3.2M parameters.
