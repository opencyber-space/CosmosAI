The ByteTrack model card documents a state-of-the-art, real-time multi-object tracker (MOT) based on PyTorch.  Its key innovation is associating every detection box (both high and low confidence), leading to fewer false negatives and robust tracking even in challenging conditions like occlusions and crowds.  It uses a ResNet50 backbone, Kalman filter, and IoU + Re-ID features for association.  Key parameters include track threshold, track buffer, and match threshold.  Performance benchmarks on MOT challenges show high MOTA (76.3%) and MOTP (85%) scores, with low ID switches and false positives.  It achieves around 30-50 FPS on NVIDIA T4 hardware depending on resolution and scene complexity.  The model requires a GPU, runs on Ubuntu, and is suitable for various applications like surveillance, traffic monitoring, and crowd analytics.  Configuration examples are provided for different performance priorities.
