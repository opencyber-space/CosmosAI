This document details the `yolov7_general_coco.json` model card, a YOLOv7 object detection model trained on the COCO 2017 dataset.  It's a closed-source PyTorch model with 37.2 million parameters, using an E-ELAN backbone, FPN-PANet neck, and YOLOv7 detection head.  Trained on 640x640 images, it detects 80 common objects (people, vehicles, animals, etc.) with a mAP@0.5 of 55.4% and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 41.6% when tested on an RTX 3060.  It supports batching up to 8, achieving up to 170 FPS.  Key configurable parameters include confidence and NMS IoU thresholds, input resolution, batch size, and mixed precision usage.  Hardware requirements include a GPU with at least 6GB memory (RTX 3060 recommended), and the runtime environment specifies Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 11.0, cuDNN 8.0, and Python 3.8.  While
