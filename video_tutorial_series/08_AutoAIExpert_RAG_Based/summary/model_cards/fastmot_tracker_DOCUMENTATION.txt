The `fastmot_tracker.json` model card describes a FastMOT-based multi-object tracking algorithm optimized for surveillance using a ResNet50 backbone and OSNet for re-identification.  It's a closed-source PyTorch model with 2.1 million parameters, pretrained on the MOT Challenge and custom surveillance data.  Key features include Kalman filter-based motion prediction and skip-frame detection.  Hardware requirements include an NVIDIA T4 GPU (recommended) with 4GB minimum memory, 4 CPU cores, and 8GB RAM.  The model accepts object detections and RGB frames as input, outputting tracked objects with IDs.  Configurable parameters include input resolution, decoder settings, object management parameters (e.g., maximum age, confirmation hits), association and matching costs, and performance optimization settings like detector skip frame.  Performance benchmarks on an NVIDIA T4 show MOTA of 0.75, MOTP of 0.82, and frame rates up to 45 FPS at 720p.  The model achieves high ID consistency, occlusion handling, and re-identification accuracy.
