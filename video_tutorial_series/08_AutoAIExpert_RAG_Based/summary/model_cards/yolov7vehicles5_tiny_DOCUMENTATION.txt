The YOLOv7-Tiny Vehicles5 model is a lightweight, speed-optimized vehicle detection model designed for real-time applications like traffic monitoring.  Built on the YOLOv7-Tiny architecture, it boasts 370 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU with minimal resource usage.  It detects five vehicle classes (car, bus, truck, motorbike, and autorickshaw) using a 416x416 pixel input (configurable up to 1280x1280) and outputs bounding boxes with confidence scores. Key features include a 6.2M parameter count, FP16 precision support, and configurable batch sizes (optimal 32-64).  The documentation details hardware requirements (minimum and recommended), runtime environment specifications, configurable parameters (confidence threshold, NMS IoU threshold, resolution, batch size, etc.), and performance benchmarks demonstrating the model's high throughput at various batch sizes.  A table summarizes performance on an NVIDIA T4 at different batch sizes, showing the trade-off between FPS, GPU utilization, and memory usage.  Finally, the data contract specifies input (RGB frames in OD1 format) and output (vehicle bounding boxes in OD1 format).
