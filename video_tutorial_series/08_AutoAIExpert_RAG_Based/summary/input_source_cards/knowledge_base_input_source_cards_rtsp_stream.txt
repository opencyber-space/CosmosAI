This document describes an RTSP camera stream component for live video processing.  It details the component's characteristics (video stream, RTSP protocol, real-time, continuous) and typical formats, resolutions, and frame rates.  It outlines common preprocessing challenges like variable lighting, compression artifacts, connection instability, and camera noise, suggesting corresponding mitigation techniques.  Resolution handling options (resizing, cropping) and common preprocessing pipelines are also provided.  Performance considerations cover CPU impact, memory usage, latency factors, throughput optimizations (frame dropping, downscaling, parallel processing), and hardware acceleration options.  Connection parameters specify URL format, authentication methods, timeout settings, and stream selection. Finally, implementation details compare libraries like OpenCV, GStreamer, and FFmpeg, highlighting their pros, cons, and basic usage.
