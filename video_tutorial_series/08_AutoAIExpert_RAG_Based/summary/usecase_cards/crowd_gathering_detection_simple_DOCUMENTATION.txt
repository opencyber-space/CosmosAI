This document details the "Crowd Gathering Detection" use case, an algorithm designed to monitor crowd density in public spaces using object detection and configurable thresholds.  It identifies when the number of people in a defined zone exceeds a specified limit for a certain duration, triggering alerts of varying severity (low, medium, high).  Key parameters include `countThreshold`, `violationFrameCount`, and `alert_interval`, allowing customization for different environments.  The system relies on object detection input and outputs crowd alerts, count metadata, and severity information.  Limitations include reduced accuracy in extremely dense crowds and dependence on clear camera views. Ethical considerations regarding privacy and fair application are also highlighted.  The document further outlines technical details like computational characteristics, dependencies, hardware/software requirements, performance benchmarks, and input/output data structures.
