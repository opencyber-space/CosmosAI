The `loitering_detection_simple.json` usecase defines a loitering detection algorithm for security monitoring, identifying individuals remaining in designated zones beyond a configurable time threshold (default 60 seconds, ranging from 30 to 300).  It relies on upstream object detection, tracking, and zone filtering, analyzing dwell time to trigger alerts.  Configurable alert intervals (default 30 seconds) prevent alert fatigue, and severity levels (low, medium, high) categorize the loitering event.  The algorithm requires minimal hardware resources and scales linearly with the number of tracked objects.  It consumes tracked object data and zone definitions, outputting loitering alerts with metadata including severity, duration, and location.  Ethical considerations regarding fairness, privacy, and bias are highlighted.
