This document describes a "Loitering Detection" use case within an AIOS Pipeline framework.  It's designed to detect individuals loitering in designated zones for extended periods.  The algorithm analyzes tracked object data, triggering alerts based on a configurable loitering threshold (default 60 seconds) and alert interval (default 30 seconds).  Alerts are assigned severity levels (low, medium, high).  The system requires object detection, tracking, zone filtering, and dwell time policy as dependencies.  It has a medium memory footprint and performs temporal analysis with alerting.  Runtime requirements include a multi-core CPU, 100MB minimum RAM, Python 3.8+, and specific OpenCV and NumPy libraries.  Benchmarks indicate it can handle 50 simultaneous objects with a 500ms alert latency.  The use case consumes tracked detections and zone definitions, producing loitering alerts and severity metadata, all using the OD1 format.  It's considered essential for security applications, with configurable parameters to balance security and alert fatigue.
