This directory houses JSON files defining computer vision use cases, each structured as a "usecase card."  These cards provide a standardized definition of business logic and behavior analysis algorithms for vision pipelines.  Each card includes a unique ID, type classification, model details (description, use, limitations, ethics), parameters, configuration options, and runtime requirements.  Key sections detail identity/metadata, model specifics, configurable parameters, resource needs, performance benchmarks, and input/output data contracts.
