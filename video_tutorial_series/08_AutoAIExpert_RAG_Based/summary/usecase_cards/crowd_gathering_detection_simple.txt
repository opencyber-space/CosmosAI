This document describes a "Crowd Gathering Detection" use case within an AIOS Pipeline framework.  It uses object detection, counting algorithms, and zone filtering to detect crowds exceeding configurable thresholds, triggering alerts with configurable severity (low, medium, high) and intervals.  The system requires a GPU and a multi-core CPU with at least 150MB RAM, Python 3.8+, OpenCV, and NumPy.  Accuracy is within Â±5% for crowds up to 50 people, with a latency of 1000ms.  It consumes detected objects and zone definitions, producing crowd alerts, count metadata, and severity metadata.  Limitations include reduced accuracy in extremely dense crowds and the need for a clear camera view. Ethical considerations regarding privacy and non-targeted monitoring are also highlighted.
