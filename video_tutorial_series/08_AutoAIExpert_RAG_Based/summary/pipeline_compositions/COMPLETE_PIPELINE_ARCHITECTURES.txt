This document defines computer vision pipeline architectures for various use cases, represented in JSON format.  It details the components and their connections for loitering detection (with a standard and ATM-specific version), intrusion detection, and multi-camera tracking. Each pipeline specifies the components in sequential stages, including input sources (camera feeds), object detection models (often YOLO variants), zone filtering, tracking algorithms, and use-case-specific logic (like loitering or line crossing detection).  Parameters for each component, such as model configuration, filtering criteria, and alert thresholds, are also included.  The loitering pipelines focus on detecting people dwelling in designated zones for extended periods. The intrusion detection pipeline identifies objects crossing predefined lines. The multi-camera tracking pipeline uses individual camera tracking and cross-camera association to maintain global tracking across multiple viewpoints.
