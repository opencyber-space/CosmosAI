This document provides example queries and expected pipeline responses for generating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, focusing on video analysis for security and surveillance.  It covers various scenarios, including basic and ATM loitering detection, high-performance real-time object detection, multi-use case systems (intrusion, loitering, and weapon detection), and edge device deployment.  Each example details the pipeline architecture, component configurations (e.g., camera settings, detection model parameters, tracking and alert logic), hardware requirements, and optimization strategies.  The document also offers guidelines for effective query patterns, emphasizing specificity in use case, performance needs, environmental constraints, hardware targets, and multi-feature requests.  Responses should include a high-level architecture, detailed component breakdown, configuration details, hardware requirements, and performance expectations.
