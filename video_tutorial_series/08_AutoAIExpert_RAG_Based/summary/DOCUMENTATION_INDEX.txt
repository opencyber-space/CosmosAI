This document indexes the knowledge base documentation, covering various aspects of a computer vision pipeline.  It's organized into categories like Chaining Blueprints (end-to-end pipelines for use cases like loitering detection and parking violation), Model Cards (information on AI/ML models like YOLOv7 and FastMOT), Usecase Cards (business logic for use cases), Policy Cards (filtering and processing logic), Input/Output Format Cards (data format specifications), Converter Cards (format conversion tools), and General Cards (system specs and datasets). Each category has a README and individual documentation files for specific components (e.g., yolov7_general_coco_DOCUMENTATION.md for the YOLOv7 model).  The document also notes the file paths for each category and aims for complete documentation coverage of all corresponding JSON files.
