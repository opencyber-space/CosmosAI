The `yolo_to_od1_converter` converts YOLO object detection format into the standardized OD1 format.  It transforms bounding box data (normalized center coordinates, width, height, and confidence score) into absolute coordinates, assigns detections to predefined zones based on polygon containment and priority, and adds zone names to the output.  The converter supports confidence and class filtering, allowing users to specify minimum confidence thresholds and desired object classes.  Configuration parameters include `confidence_threshold`, `class_filter`, and `zones` (defined by polygons and priorities).  Use cases include zone-based analysis, integration with tracking systems, and adding spatial context to detections.  The converter boasts low latency, memory usage, and CPU usage, while supporting high throughput and batch processing.
