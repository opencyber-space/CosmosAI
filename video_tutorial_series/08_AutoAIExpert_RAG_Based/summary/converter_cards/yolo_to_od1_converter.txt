The YOLO to OD1 Format Converter is a format conversion algorithm that transforms YOLO detections into OD1 format, adding zone assignments.  It consumes `yolo_format` and produces `od1_format`, mapping bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class IDs to bounding boxes, confidence scores, and zone names.  Key capabilities include format conversion, zone assignment, confidence filtering, and class filtering.  Use cases involve zone-based analysis, preparing data for OD1-compatible tracking systems, and adding spatial context to detections.  Configurable parameters include confidence threshold, class filter, and zone definitions.  The converter has low resource utilization with a latency of 1.5ms, 10MB memory usage, and low CPU usage.  It's crucial for integrating YOLO detectors with zone-aware systems.
