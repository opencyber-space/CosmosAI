This document describes a YOLO to OD1 Converter, a software component that transforms raw YOLO object detection outputs into the standardized OD1 format.  This conversion facilitates zone-based analysis, tracking integration, and compatibility with downstream processing components.  The converter maps YOLO bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class IDs to OD1's comprehensive structure, including zone assignments based on predefined polygon regions and metadata generation.  Configurable parameters include confidence threshold and class filtering for optimizing detection quality and performance.  The document details the conversion process, field mapping between YOLO and OD1, performance characteristics, and provides example configurations for various use cases like surveillance, security, and traffic monitoring.  A table illustrates the specific field mappings between the two formats, highlighting key transformations and additions.  The converter aims to bridge the gap between YOLO models and OD1-based pipelines, enabling a wider range of applications and analyses.
