This documentation describes converter cards, which are components used in computer vision pipelines to transform data between different formats.  Each card defines a specific conversion using a unique ID, name, category, and source-to-target format mapping.  Cards also specify conversion capabilities, configurable parameters, and performance characteristics.  The overall purpose is to enable interoperability and seamless integration of components within a pipeline, regardless of their individual input/output format requirements.
