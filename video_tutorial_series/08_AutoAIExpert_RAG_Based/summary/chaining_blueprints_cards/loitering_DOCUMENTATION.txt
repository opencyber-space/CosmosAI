The `loitering.json` blueprint defines a computer vision pipeline for detecting loitering behavior.  It uses a camera feed (5 FPS, 640x360) as input and processes it through a series of nodes: object detection (`obj-det-1`), person/zone filtering (`policy-1`), lightweight tracking (`tracker-1`), a 1-second dwell time filter (`policy-2`), and finally a loitering use case node (`usecase-1`) that triggers alerts for loitering exceeding 120 seconds.  The pipeline is GPU-accelerated and utilizes various parameters for object detection confidence, IoU thresholds, and tracking. Alerts are sent to MinIO, MongoDB, and Redis.  The pipeline is designed for a specific camera (`camera_100_100`) and utilizes a defined loitering zone ("ZoneLoitering").
