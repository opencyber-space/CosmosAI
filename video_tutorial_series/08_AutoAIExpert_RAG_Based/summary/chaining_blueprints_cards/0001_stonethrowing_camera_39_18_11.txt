This document defines a video analytics pipeline specification.  A source labeled "camera_39_18_11" streams video, likely from a camera, with settings like 5 fps, BGR color format, and memory mode. The video is processed by a pose estimation node ("poseDet-1") using a medium-sized model with GPU acceleration. This node has MJPEG drawing enabled for visualizing key points, but alerts are disabled. The pipeline is deployed on a cluster ("default-cluster") and specifically on the "framequeues-3" machine, utilizing its GPU.  The specification includes alert URLs and test settings, suggesting an alert mechanism although not actively used in this specific configuration.  The document also defines input and output mappings for the processing node.
