This document defines a video analytics pipeline specification.  It uses a face detection algorithm (facedetector3:v0.0.1-stable) on a video source (camera_101_100_5) with specified parameters like FPS (2/1), frame quality (90), and color format (BGR). The pipeline runs on a GPU (ID 1) of the "framequeues-11" node in the "default-cluster". The face detection node ("face-det-1") is configured with batching, a DALI decoder, and a 10G_KPS model.  MJPEG drawing is enabled with keypoint drawing, while alerts are disabled. The pipeline also includes alert URLs and test settings.  The source video is looped and treated as a live stream.
