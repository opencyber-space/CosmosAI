This document describes a weapon detection pipeline (`weaponDetectionmux_camera_55_67_11_2`, v0.0.1) running at 5 FPS on GPU 0.  The pipeline detects multiple weapon types (guns, rifles, knives, pistols) with case-insensitive class names, associating detected weapons with people.  A 50% confidence threshold and a 10-frame window are used for confirmation, triggering high-severity alerts every 300 seconds.  Advanced features include person-weapon association, zone-based filtering, and multi-class detection.  Use cases span various security-sensitive environments like airports, schools, public events, government buildings, law enforcement, and border security.  The pipeline aims for real-time detection with high accuracy and fast response for critical threat notifications.
