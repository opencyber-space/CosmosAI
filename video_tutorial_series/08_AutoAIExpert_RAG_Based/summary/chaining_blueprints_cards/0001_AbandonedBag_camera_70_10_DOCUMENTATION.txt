This document details the `abandonedBag_camera_70_10.json` blueprint, a computer vision pipeline for detecting abandoned bags.  The pipeline uses a multi-stage process: 1) **Parallel object detection** with a general object detector (`obj-det-1`) and a luggage-specific detector (`luggage-det-1`), both GPU-accelerated. 2) **Policy filtering** (`policy-obj-1`) refines detections, filtering by class confidence, zone, and associating luggage with nearby people.  It also handles duplicate object removal. 3) **Object tracking** (`tracker-det-1`) maintains object identities across frames. 4) **Abandoned object detection logic** (`usecase-1`) analyzes tracked objects, triggering alerts if luggage remains unattended for a defined period (60 seconds). The pipeline integrates with an alert system using MongoDB, Redis, and MinIO.  The input is a 4 FPS, 1920x1080 BGR camera stream.  Key parameters include confidence thresholds, NMS IoU, and various filtering distances.  The pipeline is version `v0.0.1` and tagged as `stable`.
