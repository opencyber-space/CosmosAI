This document describes the `multicameratracking_camera_55_66_9` pipeline (v0.0.1), a system for tracking people across multiple camera views at 5 FPS using a GPU (ID 0).  The pipeline uses object detection, policy filtering, tracking, person search/re-identification, and multi-camera coordination. Key features include cross-camera tracking, zone-based filtering, and a person search engine with a 600-second alert interval and medium severity.  The system leverages advanced person re-identification, a searchable person database, and real-time multi-camera synchronization.  Target use cases include security surveillance, retail analytics, transportation hubs, smart cities, and event security.  The architecture is scalable, based on a template (vDAG), and designed for long-term tracking and multi-camera fusion.
