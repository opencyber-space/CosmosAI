This document defines a crowd gathering pipeline (crowdGathering_camera_100_100, v0.0.1-stable) using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  The pipeline takes input from a source identified as "camera_100_100" with specified parameters like frame rate (1/4 fps), GPU usage, and color format (BGR). The pipeline includes an object detection node (obj-det-1) using a general object detection algorithm with specified parameters for batch size, decoder type (DALI), and confidence/NMS thresholds. This node is allocated to a specific machine (framequeues-10) and GPU (0).  MJPEG drawing is enabled for this node with a resolution of 1920x1080, while alerts are disabled. The document also includes an input/output mapping for the node and references a master DAG (default-mdag).  The pipeline appears incomplete, as the second node definition is cut off.
