This document defines a video analytics pipeline specification. It describes a source "camera_55_145_14" configured to capture video at 3 fps, using GPU 1, and sending data to "framequeues-8".  The pipeline includes an object detection node ("obj-det-1") using a gen7Det540h model with specified parameters like batch size, decoder type, and confidence thresholds. This node is copied from another VDAG ("vdag-objectIndexing_camera_55_145_11.v0.0.1:stable").  A second node ("policy-1") is partially defined, suggesting the document is incomplete.  The specification also includes alert settings with a URL and placeholder test data.  The overall structure adheres to a specific template ("template.vdag.app-layout.sample-vdag:v0.0.1-beta").
