This document describes the `socialDistance_camera_54_13_13` pipeline (v0.0.1), which uses a 2 FPS input stream to monitor social distancing compliance.  The pipeline detects people, tracks them, and analyzes their distances using a 1.8-meter minimum separation.  An alert (medium severity) is triggered if 50% of people within a zone violate the distance threshold over a 30-frame window, with alerts sent every 120 seconds.  The system uses MongoDB, Redis, and MinIO for alerts, real-time communication, and video storage, respectively.  Target use cases include COVID-19 compliance, workplace safety, public space monitoring, event management, and healthcare.  The pipeline is optimized for accurate real-world distance measurements and features configurable thresholds for adaptability.
