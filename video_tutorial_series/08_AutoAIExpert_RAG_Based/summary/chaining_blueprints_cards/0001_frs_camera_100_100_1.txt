This document defines a video analytics pipeline specification.  A source, `camera_100_100_1`, streams video at 5 fps from the `framequeues-11` node.  This stream is processed by an object detection algorithm (`obj-det-1`) running on the same node, utilizing GPU and configured with specific parameters like batch size, confidence threshold, and IOU. The pipeline includes MJPEG drawing capabilities but has alerts disabled.  The specification also defines alert URLs and test settings.  The object detection node uses a DALI decoder and is configured for a 416x416 input size, while the MJPEG drawing component is configured for a 1920x1080 output size.  The document adheres to a specific template structure and versioning scheme.
