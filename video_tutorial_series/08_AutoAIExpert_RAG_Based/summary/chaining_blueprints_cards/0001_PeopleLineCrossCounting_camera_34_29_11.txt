This document defines a video analytics pipeline specification.  It uses a source "camera_34_29_11" reading a video stream with specified parameters like FPS, resolution, and color format. The pipeline runs on node "framequeues-5" utilizing GPU 2.  It includes an object detection node ("obj-det-1") using a specified algorithm with parameters for batch size, confidence threshold, and non-maximum suppression.  The pipeline also defines alert and database storage settings, including a MongoDB connection.  MJPEG drawing is enabled for visualization, while alerting is disabled.
