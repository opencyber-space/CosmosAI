This document defines a video analytics pipeline configuration.  A source labeled "camera_55_53_13" streams video at 5 fps, using the memory mode and looping with live behavior.  The video is processed by an object detection node ("obj-det-1") using a GPU on the "framequeues-1" machine. This node utilizes a DALI decoder, has specific settings for batch size, dimensions, and inference parameters (confidence 0.2, IoU 0.45, max detections 300).  MJPEG drawing is enabled at 1920x1080 resolution, while alerting is disabled. The pipeline also includes general settings like alert URL and master DAG configuration.
