This document describes the `groupRunning_camera_55_53_13` pipeline, a computer vision system designed to detect groups of people running.  The pipeline uses a 5 FPS stream from `camera_55_53_13` and processes it through several stages: object detection (`obj-det-1`), multi-class association and zone filtering (`policy-1`), person-specific filtering (`policy-2`), advanced object tracking (`tracker-1`), and finally group running analysis (`usecase-1`). The `usecase-1` component estimates speed and identifies group running behavior based on configurable parameters like group size, speed threshold, and time interval.  Alerts are generated and integrated with MongoDB, Redis, and MinIO. The pipeline is optimized for a 640x360 input resolution and utilizes GPU acceleration for performance.  It's currently in a stable release (`v0.0.1`) and uses a memory-based processing mode with loop video enabled for testing.
