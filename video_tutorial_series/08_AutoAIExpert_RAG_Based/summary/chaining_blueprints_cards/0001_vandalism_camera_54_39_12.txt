This document defines a video analytics pipeline for vandalism detection using camera "camera_54_39_12".  The pipeline uses a pose estimation algorithm ("poseDet-1") running on GPU 1 of the "framequeues-3" machine. The video source is processed at 4 fps, looped, and treated as a live stream.  The pose estimation node uses a medium-sized model with DALI decoding and Gaussian interpolation. MJPEG output with keypoint drawing is enabled, while alerts are disabled. The pipeline sends alerts to "http://test-alerts.io" and retrieves alert IDs from "http://serverip:serverport/getalertid". The output resolution for MJPEG is 1920x1080.  The entire pipeline is managed by a master DAG named "default-mdag" also located on "framequeues-3".
