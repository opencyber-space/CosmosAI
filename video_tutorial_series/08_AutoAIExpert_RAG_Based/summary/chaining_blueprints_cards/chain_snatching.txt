This document defines a chain snatching detection pipeline named "snatchingDetection_cameras_100_100" (version v0.0.1-stable).  It uses a video source identified as "cameras_100_100" with settings for frame rate, GPU usage, and memory mode. The pipeline includes a pose estimation node ("poseDet-1") utilizing a medium-sized model with specified decoder and batching settings.  The pipeline sends alerts to "http://test-alerts.io" and retrieves alert IDs from "http://serverip:alertidport/getalertid".  The pose estimation node is configured to run on the "framequeues-1" machine, utilizing GPU 1, and includes MJPEG and alert configurations (currently disabled).  The document is incomplete, cutting off mid-IOMap definition, suggesting further nodes and connections are likely defined elsewhere.
