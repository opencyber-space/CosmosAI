This document describes the `crowd_gathering.json` blueprint, a computer vision pipeline for detecting crowd gatherings.  The pipeline takes a 0.25 FPS video stream from a specified camera (`camera_100_100`) and processes it through three main components: object detection (`obj-det-1`), policy filtering (`policy-1`), and a crowd gathering use case node (`usecase-1`).  The object detection component identifies objects within the frames, and the policy filter isolates "person" detections within a predefined zone called "ZoneCrowd." The use case node analyzes the number of people in this zone and triggers a medium-severity alert if the count exceeds 20 for 5 consecutive frames. Alerts are sent every 10 minutes to prevent spam and are stored in MinIO, MongoDB, and Redis. The pipeline utilizes GPU acceleration and batch processing for efficiency.  Key parameters include confidence thresholds (0.4 for detection, 0.5 for filtering), the crowd count threshold (20), and the alert interval (600 seconds).
