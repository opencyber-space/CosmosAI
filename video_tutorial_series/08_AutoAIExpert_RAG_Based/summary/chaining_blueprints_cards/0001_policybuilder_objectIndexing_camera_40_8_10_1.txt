This document defines a video analytics pipeline specification.  A source "camera_40_8_10_1" streams video, configured for memory mode, looping, and live processing with specified parameters like FPS, resolution, and color format. The pipeline includes an object detection node ("obj-det-1") using a specified algorithm with settings for GPU usage, batch size, and image dimensions.  It's followed by a policy node ("policy-1"), though its details are incomplete in the provided excerpt.  The object detection node outputs are mapped as inputs to the policy node.  Alerting is configured with a specified URL, but disabled within the individual nodes' parameters.  The pipeline is deployed on a specific cluster and machine ("framequeues-1").  MJPEG drawing is enabled for the object detection node at a 1920x1080 resolution.
