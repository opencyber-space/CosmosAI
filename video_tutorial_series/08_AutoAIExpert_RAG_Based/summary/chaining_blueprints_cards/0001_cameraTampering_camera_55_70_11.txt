This document defines a video analytics pipeline for camera tampering detection.  It specifies a camera source (`camera_55_70_11_1`) with parameters like frame rate, resolution, and quality. The pipeline uses a camera tampering detection algorithm (`camTamp_360h_640w`) with specified batch size and decoder settings.  Alerts are enabled and configured to be stored in MinIO and MongoDB, and pushed to Redis.  The pipeline uses a default runtime DAG (`default-mdag`) and frame queue (`framequeues-6`).  An alert URL (`http://test-alerts.io`) and an alert ID URL (`http://serverip:serverport/getalertid`) are also defined.
