This document describes an intrusion detection pipeline (`intrusion_camera_56_3_10`, version `v0.0.1`) running at 5 FPS on GPU 0.  The pipeline detects intrusions by analyzing object detection results, filtering by policy, tracking objects, and identifying line crossings within defined zones (ZoneIntrusion1 and ZoneIntrusion2).  It features directional line crossing detection with visual arrow indicators, a 60-second alert interval, and a medium severity level.  Use cases include perimeter security, restricted area access control, and industrial safety.  The system supports multiple zones, provides fast response with real-time alerts, and analyzes crossing direction for accurate intrusion detection.
