This document describes a computer vision pipeline (`parking_violation.json`) for detecting parking violations.  The pipeline uses a camera feed (`camera_100_100`) at 1 FPS and processes it on GPU 2.  It first detects vehicles using a specialized model (`obj-det-1`), then filters these detections to only include specified vehicle types (cars, buses, trucks, auto-rickshaws, bikes, and motorbikes) within a designated parking zone ("ZoneParking") using a policy filter (`policy-1`).  A tracking algorithm (`tracker-1`) maintains vehicle identities across frames.  A dwell time policy (`policy-2`) pre-filters tracks based on a 3-second dwell time to remove transient vehicles. Finally, the parking violation usecase node (`usecase-1`) identifies violations based on a 120-second dwell time, sending medium-severity alerts every 10 minutes. The pipeline includes configurations for storage (MinIO) and a database (likely MongoDB, though incomplete in the provided excerpt).  The pipeline uses a specific template and runtime environment, and is versioned for management.
