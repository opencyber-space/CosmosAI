This document describes the `objectIndexing_camera_55_145_14` pipeline (v0.0.1) for object indexing and cataloging, using a height-based size change analysis.  The pipeline, running at 5 FPS on GPU 0, detects objects, filters them based on policy, tracks them, performs indexing and analysis (triggered by a 50% height change with 5-second alert intervals), and stores the data in a database.  Key features include object cataloging, size monitoring, class replacement, and zone-based indexing.  Targeted use cases include inventory management, security monitoring, asset management, quality control, and evidence collection.  The pipeline boasts fast indexing, precise size analysis, database integration, and a scalable template-based architecture.
