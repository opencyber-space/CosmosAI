This document describes a video analytics pipeline configuration. It defines a source "camera_55_66_9" capturing video at 1 fps, using GPU, and configured for memory mode with looping and live processing.  The pipeline includes an object detection node ("obj-det-1") using a specified algorithm with parameters like batch size, decoder type, and confidence thresholds. This node is scaled based on a pre-existing VDAG.  A second node "policy-1" is partially defined, suggesting a multi-node pipeline.  The configuration also specifies alert settings with a URL and placeholder test data.  The entire pipeline utilizes a master DAG named "default-mdag" and uses "framequeues-8" for database location and controller/allocation node.
