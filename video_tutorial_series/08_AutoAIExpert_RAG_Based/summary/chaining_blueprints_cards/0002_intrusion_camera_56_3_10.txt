This document defines a video analytics pipeline (VDAG) named "intrusion_camera_56_3_10" (v0.0.1-stable). It uses a default master DAG ("default-mdag") and retrieves video from source "camera_56_3_10" with specified parameters like FPS (3), GPU usage (ID 1), memory mode, looping, and color format (BGR).  The pipeline sends alerts to "http://test-alerts.io" and retrieves alert IDs from "http://serverip:serverport/getalertid".  It includes two nodes: "obj-det-1" performs object detection using a specified algorithm with parameters for batch size, decoding, and model configuration (confidence 0.4, IoU 0.45).  The second node, "policy-1," is incompletely described but appears to be an algorithm node as well.  The "obj-det-1" node is also scaled based on a separate VDAG ("vdag-intrusion_camera_101_17.v0.0.1:stable").  Input and output mappings are defined for "obj-det-1".
