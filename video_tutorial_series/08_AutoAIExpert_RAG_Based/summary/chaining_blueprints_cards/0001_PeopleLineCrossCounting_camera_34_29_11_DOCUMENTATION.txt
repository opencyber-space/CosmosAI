This document describes a computer vision pipeline (`peopleLineCrossCounting_camera_34_29_11`) for counting people crossing lines within designated zones, using a 5 FPS camera stream.  The pipeline uses a lower resolution (640x360) for faster processing. It first detects people using a GPU-accelerated object detection model (`obj-det-1`).  Then, a policy filter (`policy-1`) selects detections within "Zone1" and "Zone2", based on the bottom point of their bounding boxes.  A tracking algorithm (`tracker-1`) maintains object identities across frames. Finally, a line crossing counter (`usecase-1`) analyzes tracked objects and generates alerts every 30 seconds for crossing events, storing data in MongoDB (`VIP_DATA` and `VIP_ALERT`), Redis, and MinIO. The pipeline is deployed on `framequeues-5` and uses GPU 2.  The document details component configurations, data flow, and the overall logic of the people counting application.
