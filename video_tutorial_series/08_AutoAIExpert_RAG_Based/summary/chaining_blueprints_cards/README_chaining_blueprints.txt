This documentation describes chaining blueprint cards, JSON files defining end-to-end computer vision pipelines.  Each blueprint specifies a pipeline (`componentType: node.algorithm.pipeline`) with a unique ID, version, and a body containing metadata, node configurations, and connections.  Key sections define the pipeline's identity, input source, algorithm nodes (AI/ML, policy, use case, and utility), data flow graph, global settings, and scaling specifications.  The files in the directory represent complete solutions for specific surveillance/monitoring scenarios, combining multiple AI models and business logic.
