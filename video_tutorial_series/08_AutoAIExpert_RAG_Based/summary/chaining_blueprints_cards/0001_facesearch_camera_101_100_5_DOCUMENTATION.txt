The document details a face search pipeline (`facesearch_camera_101_100_5`) using a 2 FPS video stream from `camera_101_100_5`.  The pipeline employs several components: face detection (`face-det-1`) using a high-accuracy model with keypoint extraction and a 0.6 confidence threshold, zone and class filtering (`policy-1`), face recognition (`frs-1`) returning top 3 matches, quality filtering (`policy-2`) based on size relative to the frame, and finally logging and search management (`usecase-1`) which stores data like camera ID, embeddings, and image URLs in a database and MinIO. The pipeline runs on GPU 1 of `framequeues-11` and uses a memory-based processing mode.  Data flows linearly from the camera to the face detection node, through each processing stage, and finally to the logging and search component.  The system is designed for high accuracy and uses multiple filters to ensure quality results.  Alerting functionality is also integrated via specified URLs.
