This document describes a video analytics pipeline configuration.  It specifies a source "camera_54_13_13" capturing video at 2 FPS, using GPU 2, and sending data to "framequeues-3".  An object detection node ("obj-det-1") processes the video using a specified algorithm with parameters like batch size, confidence threshold (0.2), and intersection over union (0.45). This node is based on a template and includes scaling specifications referencing another VDAG.  The configuration also includes alert settings with a URL and placeholder test data.  A second node ("policy-1") is partially defined, suggesting the pipeline involves further processing after object detection.  The document adheres to a specific template structure with versioning information.
