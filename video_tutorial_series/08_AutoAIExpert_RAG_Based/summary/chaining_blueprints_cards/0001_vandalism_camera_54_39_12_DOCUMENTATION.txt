This document describes the `vandalism_camera_54_39_12` pipeline (v0.0.1) for detecting vandalism, running at 5 FPS on GPU 1.  The pipeline uses pose estimation (`poseDet-1`), object tracking (`tracker-1`), and a multi-stage analysis (`policy-1`, `policy-2`, `usecase-1`, `usecase-2`, `usecase-3`) to identify vandalism.  The system analyzes complex movement patterns with a 300-second alert interval and medium severity level.  Use cases include property, public space, and asset protection, graffiti prevention, and criminal activity monitoring.  The pipeline leverages multi-node processing, pose-based detection, and sequential analysis for accurate real-time alerts.
