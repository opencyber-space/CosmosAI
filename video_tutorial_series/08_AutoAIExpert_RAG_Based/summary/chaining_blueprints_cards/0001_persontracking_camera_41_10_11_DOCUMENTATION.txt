This document describes a person tracking pipeline (`persontracking_camera_41_10_11`) using a video stream from `camera_41_10_11` at 1 FPS. The pipeline uses a four-stage process: object detection (`obj-det-1`), policy filtering (`policy-1`), object tracking (`tracker-1`), and a person tracking engine (`usecase-1`) for analytics and logging.  The pipeline is GPU-accelerated and configured for memory-based processing.  Key features include a 20-frame trajectory history, zone entry/exit detection, and comprehensive logging to MongoDB, Redis, and MinIO every 5 seconds.  The logged data includes camera ID, object ID, confidence, timestamp, ROI, zone, and entry/exit times.  Target applications include security monitoring, retail analytics, facility management, safety compliance, and behavioral analysis.  The system requires an NVIDIA GPU, 4GB GPU memory, 8GB RAM, and SSD storage.  Expected latency is 200-400ms per frame.
