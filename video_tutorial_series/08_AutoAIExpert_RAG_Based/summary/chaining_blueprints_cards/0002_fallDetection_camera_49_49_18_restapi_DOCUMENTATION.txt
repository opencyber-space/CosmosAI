This document describes the `fallDetection_camera_49_49_18_restapi` pipeline (v0.0.1), a system for detecting falls using a two-stage process.  It processes a 5 FPS input stream, utilizing GPU ID 1.  First, a REST API call to an external service performs initial fall detection.  This is followed by a dual-stage internal fall detection process with a 0.7 confidence threshold for falls and 0.5 for person detection.  The system monitors for a 60-second fall duration, requires a 2-second non-fall period for recovery, and limits alerts to every 300 seconds.  Target use cases include healthcare, elderly care, home and workplace safety, and public spaces.  The pipeline aims for high accuracy and real-time monitoring through its dual-stage validation and REST API integration.
