This document defines a video analytics pipeline. A source, `camera_49_49_18_1`, streams video at 1/4 fps from the `framequeues-3` node.  The pipeline includes a "usecase-rest-api" node that performs object detection via a REST API endpoint and a "fallDet-1" node using the `fall7Detection_640h_896` algorithm.  The REST API node uses a specified URL, confidence threshold of 0.3, and connects to a database. The fall detection node is configured with specific settings like batch size, decoder type, and image dimensions, leveraging GPU acceleration.  Alerts are configured with a specified URL but are currently disabled for both nodes. The pipeline is deployed on the `framequeues-3` machine within the `default-cluster`.
