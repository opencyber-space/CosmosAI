This document describes an FRS (Face Recognition System) pipeline (`frs_camera_100_100_1`, version `v0.0.1`) that performs real-time face identification and tracking.  The pipeline uses a multi-stage process: person detection (obj-det-1), person tracking (tracker-1), face detection (face-det-1), and face recognition (frs-1).  Several policy filters refine the process, including zone filters for both person and face detection, a scale filter for face size, and an association engine (policy-4) linking faces to tracked individuals.  The system uses GPU acceleration and batch processing for performance.  A voting mechanism within the use case logic component (usecase-1) requires a 95% match score and 15 recognitions before confirming an identity.  Results are outputted after processing through this logic, which also handles alerts.  The pipeline integrates with MINIO for image storage.
