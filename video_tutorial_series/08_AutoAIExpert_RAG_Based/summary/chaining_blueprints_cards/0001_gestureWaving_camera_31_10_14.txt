This document defines a video analytics pipeline configuration.  It specifies a source "camera_31_10_14" capturing video at 3 fps, looped, and treated as live, with settings for frame quality and color format. The video is processed by a pose estimation node ("poseDet-1") using a medium-sized model with specified batch size and decoder settings.  The pipeline runs on the "framequeues-3" machine, utilizing GPU.  MJPEG output is enabled with drawing parameters for key points and other visualizations, while alerts are disabled.  The configuration also includes alert URLs and test settings.  The pipeline uses a master DAG named "default-mdag" and stores data in "framequeues-3".  The document follows a specific template structure for application layout and node definitions.
