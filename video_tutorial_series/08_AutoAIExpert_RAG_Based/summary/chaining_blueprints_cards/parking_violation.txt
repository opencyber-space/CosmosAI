This document defines a parking violation detection pipeline (parkingViolation_camera_100_100, v0.0.1-stable) using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  It specifies a video source (camera_100_100) with parameters like FPS, resolution, and color format, processed on GPU 2 of the "framequeues-2" node.  An object detection algorithm (obj-det-1) using a vehicles5Detection model with specified batch size, decoder, and dimensions processes the video stream.  The pipeline includes settings for alert URLs and test parameters.  MJPEG drawing is enabled for visualization, while alerting is disabled. The object detection node has a confidence threshold of 0.4 and an NMS IOU threshold of 0.4.  The pipeline utilizes the "framequeues-2" node for resource allocation and operates within the "default-cluster".
