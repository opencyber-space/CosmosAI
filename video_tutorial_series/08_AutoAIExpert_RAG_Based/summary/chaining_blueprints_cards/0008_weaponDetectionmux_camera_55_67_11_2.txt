This document defines a video analytics pipeline for weapon detection.  It specifies a source "camera_55_67_11_3" with parameters like frame rate, GPU usage, and video looping. The pipeline uses a weapon detection algorithm "weapon7Detection_608h_896" on node "weaponDet-1" with specified settings for batch size, decoder type, and image dimensions.  The pipeline is configured to run on cluster "default-cluster", machine "framequeues-3", and GPU 2.  Alerting is configured with a URL but currently disabled.  MJPEG drawing is enabled, while actual alerts are disabled. The configuration includes parameters for confidence threshold (0.1) and non-maximum suppression (0.4).
