This document defines a video analytics pipeline (`loitering_pipeline`) using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) specification.  The pipeline ingests video from a source (`camera_100_100`) with specified parameters like FPS, resolution, and color format. It processes the video stream through two nodes: an object detection node (`obj-det-1`) and a policy node (`policy-1`). The object detection node uses a GPU-accelerated model with specified settings for batch size, decoding, and inference parameters. The policy node's specification is incomplete in the provided excerpt.  The pipeline also includes settings for alerts, with a specified URL (`http://test-alerts.io`) and an alert ID URL.  The entire pipeline is configured to run on a specific machine (`framequeues-2`) and GPU (ID 1) within a Kubernetes cluster.
