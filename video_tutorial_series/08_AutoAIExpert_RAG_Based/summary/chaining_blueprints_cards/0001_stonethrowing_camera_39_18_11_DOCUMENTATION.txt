This document describes a stone throwing detection pipeline (`stonethrowing_camera_39_18_11`, v0.0.1) operating at 5 FPS on GPU 0.  The pipeline uses pose estimation to analyze right arm angles (wrist-elbow-shoulder) within a defined zone ("ZoneStone").  A 30-frame window assesses behavior, requiring a minimum 20-frame violation window with 80% positive detection for confirmation.  Group detection triggers when at least 3 people exhibit the throwing motion.  Alerts, classified as high severity, are sent every 300 seconds.  Use cases include security monitoring for riots, public safety, event security, law enforcement, and campus safety.  The system aims for real-time performance with precise angle computation and high accuracy.
