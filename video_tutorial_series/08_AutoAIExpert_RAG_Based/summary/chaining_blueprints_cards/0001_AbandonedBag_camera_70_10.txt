This document defines a video analytics pipeline for abandoned bag detection.  It specifies a source as camera `camera_100_100` with parameters like FPS (4), color format (BGR), and connection retries. The pipeline uses a master DAG `default-mdag` and primarily runs on node `framequeues-6`.  An object detection algorithm (`general7Detection_1080_1920`) is applied with specified settings for batch size, GPU usage, and image dimensions.  The pipeline includes an alert URL (`http://test-alerts.io`) and an alert ID URL.  MJPEG drawing is enabled, while alerts are disabled within the object detection node itself. The object detection node has a confidence threshold of 0.4 and an NMS IOU threshold of 0.4.
