This document describes the `chain_snatching.json` blueprint, a computer vision pipeline for detecting chain snatching incidents using a "FALL-AND-RUN" logic.  The pipeline (`chain_snatching_pipeline`, version `v0.0.1`) uses a memory-based processing mode with a 5 FPS input from the `cameras_100_100` source.  It leverages several components: pose detection (`poseDet-1`) to identify keypoints, fall detection (`fallDet-1`), and object tracking (`tracker-1`).  Four policy filtering nodes (`policy-1` to `policy-fall-1`) handle person zone filtering, interaction detection, calibration, and fall event validation respectively. A speed estimation node (`usecase-speed-1`) calculates movement speed.  The pipeline sends alerts to `http://test-alerts.io` and retrieves alert IDs from `http://serverip:alertidport/getalertid`.  It utilizes GPU acceleration and batch processing for performance optimization.  The document details each component's configuration, including input/output resolutions, thresholds, and specific parameters for each algorithm and policy.
