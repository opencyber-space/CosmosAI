This document describes the `policybuilder_objectIndexing_camera_40_8_10_1` blueprint (v0.0.1) for policy-driven object indexing.  The pipeline processes a 5 FPS input stream on GPU 0, performing object detection followed by policy-based filtering, categorization, and indexing before storing results in a database.  Key features include dynamic policy creation, advanced multi-stage and zone-based filtering, object class replacement, and height-based size change analysis (50% threshold, 5-second alert interval, high severity).  Use cases include automated policy generation, smart warehousing, security automation, quality assurance, and research.  The system aims for high accuracy, fast indexing, and precise size monitoring through intelligent policy automation.
