This document describes a video analytics pipeline configuration for person tracking on camera `camera_41_10_11`.  The pipeline uses a master DAG named `default-mdag` and retrieves frames from the specified camera with settings like 1 FPS, GPU processing, and BGR color format.  It includes an object detection node (`obj-det-1`) using a `general7Detection_360h_640` algorithm with specified parameters like batch size, confidence threshold, and IOU. This node is seemingly copied from another VDAG (`vdag-crowdGathering_camera_55_165_12.v0.0.1:stable`). The document also specifies an alert URL and includes a partially defined second node (`policy-1`), suggesting an incomplete configuration.  The pipeline utilizes framequeues-3 for data storage and controller functions.
