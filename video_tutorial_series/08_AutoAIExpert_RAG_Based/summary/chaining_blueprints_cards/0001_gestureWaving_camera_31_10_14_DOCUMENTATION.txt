This document describes a computer vision pipeline (`wavehandraise_camera_31_10_14`, version `v0.0.1`) for detecting hand waving gestures using a 3 FPS camera stream.  The pipeline uses pose estimation (`poseDet-1`), filters results by zone and person class (`policy-1`), tracks objects (`tracker-1`), applies action detection policies (`policy-2` checking for movement and waving actions), and finally triggers alerts through `usecase-1` if a waving gesture is detected.  The pipeline is optimized for a balance of accuracy and speed, using GPU acceleration and batch processing where applicable.  Alerts are integrated with MongoDB, Redis, and MinIO.  The camera input is a 1920x1080 BGR stream, and the pipeline includes visualization capabilities at various stages.  The pipeline is designed for applications like detecting SOS signals or greetings.
