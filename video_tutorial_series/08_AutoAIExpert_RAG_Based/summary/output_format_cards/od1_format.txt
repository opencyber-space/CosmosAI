This document specifies the OD1 Bounding-Box Output format (version 1.1) for generic vision tasks.  It's a list-of-lists structure used by detectors, trackers, and post-processors. Each inner list represents a detected object and contains fields for class, confidence score, zone, source path, tracker ID, bounding box, polygon, timestamp, and a "props" dictionary.  The "props" dictionary holds additional information like pose keypoints, dwell time, color, age, gender, actions, speed, direction, facial features, interaction detection, and activity confidence.  The document details the expected format and provides examples for each property within the "props" dictionary, along with their potential producers and use cases.  Modules producing this format should declare `"produces":["od1_list"]`.
