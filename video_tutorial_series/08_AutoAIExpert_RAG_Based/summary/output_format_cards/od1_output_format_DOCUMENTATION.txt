The OD1 (Object Detection 1) Output Format is a standardized schema for computer vision pipelines, enabling consistent data exchange between components like detectors, trackers, and analyzers.  The core output is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a detected object and contains: `class`, `score`, `zone`, `path`, `id`, `roi` (bounding box), `polygon`, `timestamp`, and `props`.  The `props` field is a dictionary allowing extensible metadata like pose keypoints, dwell time, color, age, gender, speed, direction, actions, and interaction status.  This flexible format facilitates rich data enrichment throughout the pipeline, supporting diverse computer vision tasks.  The document specifies data types, ranges, examples, and potential sources for each field, ensuring clear interpretation and interoperability.
