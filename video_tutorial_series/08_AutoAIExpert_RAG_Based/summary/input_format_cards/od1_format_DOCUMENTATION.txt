The OD1 (Object Detection format 1) is a standardized data structure (`od1_format.json`, schema version 1.1) for computer vision pipelines.  It uses a list-of-lists format with 9 core fields: `class` (string), `score` (float 0.0-1.0), `zone` (string), `path` (string, comma-separated lineage), `id` (string), `roi` (integer list [x1, y1, x2, y2]), `polygon` (list of coordinate pairs), `timestamp` (float, epoch milliseconds), and `props` (dictionary).  The `props` field allows for extended properties like pose keypoints, dwell time, color, age, gender, actions, speed, direction, and facial features, each with its own specified format and use cases. This format facilitates object detection, tracking, and analysis by providing a consistent structure for data exchange between different computer vision modules.
