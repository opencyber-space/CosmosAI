This document specifies the OD1 Bounding-Box Input format (version 1.1) for computer vision modules.  It defines a list-of-lists structure where each inner list represents a detected object and contains fields for class, confidence score, zone, source path, tracker ID, bounding box, polygon, timestamp, and custom properties.  The `props` field allows for flexible addition of specific information like pose keypoints, dwell time, color, age, gender, actions, speed, direction, and facial features, each with suggested formats and use cases.  Modules consuming this format should declare `consumes:["od1_list"]`.
