This documentation describes a directory of JSON files called "input format cards" that define standardized data structures for computer vision pipelines.  Each card uniquely identifies a data format (using `componentId`, `componentType`, `name`, `description`, and `schema_version`) and specifies its structure, including an ordered list of required fields (`structure`), detailed field specifications (`field_specs`), and extended properties (`props_specifications`).  Key sections within each card provide format identity, schema structure, property specifications, usage examples, and data contract information.  These cards promote data compatibility and enable automated pipeline construction.
