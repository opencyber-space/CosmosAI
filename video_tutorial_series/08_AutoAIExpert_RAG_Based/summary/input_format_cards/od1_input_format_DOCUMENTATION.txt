The OD1 (Object Detection Format 1) is a standardized input format for computer vision pipelines, defining a list-of-lists structure to represent detected objects. Each inner list contains nine fields: `class` (string label), `score` (confidence), `zone` (location name), `path` (zone lineage), `id` (tracker ID), `roi` (bounding box coordinates), `polygon` (object outline), `timestamp` (epoch milliseconds), and `props` (dictionary for extended properties).  The `props` field can include standardized information like pose keypoints, dwell time, color, age, gender, actions, speed, direction, and facial features.  Components interacting with this format should declare `consumes: ["od1_list"]` or `produces: ["od1_list"]` for compatibility.
