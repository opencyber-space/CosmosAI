The "Inside Zone" policy is a spatial filtering algorithm using the Shapely library to determine if the pivot point (top, mid, or bottom) of a bounding box falls within predefined 2D polygonal zones.  It's designed for real-time object filtering based on location, consuming bounding boxes and zone definitions (OD1 format) and producing filtered detections and zone metadata (also OD1).  Key features include dynamic updates to zones and parameters via API endpoints, low memory footprint, and support for up to 50 zones with a throughput of 5000 objects per second and 0.2ms latency.  It requires Shapely and NumPy, runs on any modern CPU with minimal RAM, and offers pixel-perfect spatial precision.  However, it's limited to 2D filtering and pivot-point based logic.  Ethical considerations regarding potential bias in zone definitions, especially in surveillance, are highlighted.
