This document describes a zone filtering policy (named "Zone Filtering Policy") for spatial filtering of detections.  It uses Shapely and NumPy to determine if detections are within predefined zones based on configurable intersection criteria.  Key features include adjustable intersection thresholds, selectable reference points (center, bottom-center, entire bounding box), and the ability to include/exclude specific zones.  The policy supports runtime updates to zones and thresholds via API endpoints.  Performance is computationally intensive, scaling with object, zone, and polygon complexity, but optimized for typical surveillance scenarios with benchmarks provided for throughput and accuracy.  It consumes positioned detections and zone definitions in OD1 format and produces filtered detections, zone metadata, and zone counts, also in OD1 format.  The policy requires Shapely and NumPy as dependencies.
