The `inside_zone_policy.json` policy card defines a 2D spatial filtering policy using the Shapely library.  It filters object bounding boxes based on whether their chosen pivot point (top, middle, or bottom center) falls within predefined polygonal zones.  These zones are dynamically configurable at runtime via API endpoints, allowing for real-time modifications, additions, and removals.  The policy relies on input bounding box data and zone definitions, outputting filtered detections with zone membership information and zone metadata like object counts and density.  It has a low computational footprint and high throughput, processing thousands of objects per second across numerous zones.  Key limitations include its 2D nature, reliance on predefined zones and pivot points, and the use of static polygon shapes. Ethical considerations regarding bias, privacy, and transparency in zone definitions are also highlighted.
