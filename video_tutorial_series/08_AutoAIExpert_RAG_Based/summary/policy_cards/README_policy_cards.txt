This documentation describes the structure and usage of policy cards, which are JSON files defining filtering, processing, and business logic for computer vision pipelines.  Each card has a standardized structure including an ID, type, model details, parameters, configuration, and dynamic parameters.  Key sections detail the policy's identity, purpose, configuration, runtime update capabilities, resource requirements, performance, and data contract.  The cards are categorized into spatial filters (like zone membership), classification filters (based on class and confidence), temporal filters (dwell time and association), and data processing policies (class replacement and interaction analysis).  Each policy type is represented by a separate JSON file within the directory.
