The Interaction Policy is a pose-based activity detection system using OD1 pose keypoint data.  It leverages OpenCV and NumPy to analyze single and multi-person actions, including gestures like waving and clapping, proximity, posture (standing), and joint angles.  It requires OD1 data with COCO-17 formatted keypoints.  Configurable parameters include the activity type, specific keypoints to analyze, proximity thresholds, and violation tolerances.  The system extracts keypoints, performs geometric analysis based on the chosen activity type, evaluates against thresholds, and outputs confidence scores.  It boasts a low memory footprint, CPU-based processing, and high throughput (200 persons/second).  Accuracy ranges from 82.3% for action recognition to 87.5% for interaction detection.
