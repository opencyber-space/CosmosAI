The Confidence Filter is a Python-based filtering policy designed to improve the precision of object detection pipelines by removing low-confidence detections.  It keeps only objects with detection confidence scores above a configurable threshold (default 0.5) and allows for inclusive filtering and score normalization.  The policy has a low computational overhead (O(n)) and minimal memory footprint, supporting runtime updates to its parameters (score, inclusive, normalize_scores).  Benchmarks indicate high throughput (150,000 objects/second) and significant reductions in false positives (30-70%) with a trade-off in recall (5-20% reduction).  It consumes "scored_detections" in OD1 format and produces "high_confidence_detections" also in OD1 format.  While effective, limitations include a global threshold across all classes and the potential removal of valid, low-confidence detections. Ethical considerations highlight the potential for disparate impact across demographic groups due to the confidence threshold.  The policy's source code is available on GitHub and further information on confidence scores and precision-recall trade-offs is linked.  Tuning the threshold is crucial for optimal performance in specific applications.
