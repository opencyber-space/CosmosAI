The Class Filter Policy documentation describes a Python-based filtering component for object detection pipelines.  It filters objects based on a user-defined list of allowed classes (`allowed_classes`), offering case-sensitive or insensitive matching (`case_sensitive`) and the option to pass unknown classes (`pass_unknown`).  Key features include high throughput (100,000 objects/second) and low latency (0.01ms/object), minimal resource usage, and runtime updatability.  The policy is designed for efficient pipeline optimization by reducing downstream processing load.  It's ideally placed after object detection and before computationally expensive components.  Example configurations demonstrate its use in various applications like surveillance, traffic monitoring, and retail analytics.  The policy is robust, handling edge cases like empty lists and null values gracefully.
