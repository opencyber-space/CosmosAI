The Class Confidence Filter Policy (ID: pol-class-conf-filter) is a Python-based hybrid filtering system designed for dynamic object detection.  It combines class filtering, confidence threshold filtering, and time-based parameter adjustments.  Users specify allowed object classes and a minimum confidence score.  These parameters can be modified dynamically at runtime and configured to change automatically within defined time ranges.  The policy receives classified object detections, evaluates the current time against configured rules, applies the appropriate parameters, filters the detections, and outputs the filtered results along with active parameter information and statistics.  It's highly performant, capable of processing 50,000 objects/second with low latency, and suitable for various applications like surveillance, traffic monitoring, and retail analytics, where adaptive filtering based on time of day or specific events is beneficial.  Integration requires object detections in OD1 format with class labels and confidence scores.  The policy depends on Python 3.7+ and the `pytz` library.
