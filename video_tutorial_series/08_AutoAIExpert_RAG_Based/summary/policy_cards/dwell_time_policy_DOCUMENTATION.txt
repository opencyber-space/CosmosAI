The Dwell Time Policy is a Python-based temporal filtering component designed to detect loitering or persistent presence of tracked objects.  It receives tracked detections (OD1 format) and outputs loitering alerts and dwell time metadata (also OD1).  Configurable parameters include the loitering threshold (default 300 seconds), reset timeout (default 30 seconds), track ID field, minimum detection confidence (default 0.5), and zone-specific thresholds.  The policy tracks object presence, accumulating dwell time based on timestamps and confidence levels.  When the accumulated time exceeds the configured threshold for a specific zone (or a global threshold if zone-specific configuration is disabled), a loitering alert is triggered.  The policy supports runtime updates to its parameters via API endpoints.  It's designed for low computational overhead (O(n)) and can handle numerous tracked objects simultaneously.  Use cases include security surveillance, retail analytics, airport security, and various other scenarios requiring monitoring of prolonged presence or abandoned objects.
