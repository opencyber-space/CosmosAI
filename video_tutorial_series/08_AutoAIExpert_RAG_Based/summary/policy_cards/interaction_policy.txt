This document describes an "Interaction Policy" node for pose analysis, using OpenCV and NumPy.  It detects user activities and interactions based on pose keypoints provided by an upstream object detection (OD1) component.  Configurable parameters include the activity type (e.g., interaction, waving), specific keypoints to analyze, distance thresholds, and actions.  It has low memory requirements, runs on any modern CPU, and outputs interaction detection status, activity confidence, and keypoint violations.  Benchmarks indicate a throughput of 200 persons per second with low latency and reasonable accuracy.  The policy requires accurate upstream pose estimation and threshold tuning per camera setup. Ethical considerations regarding privacy are also noted.
