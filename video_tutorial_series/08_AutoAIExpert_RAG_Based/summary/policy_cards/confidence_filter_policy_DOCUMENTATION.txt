The Confidence Filter Policy is a Python-based quality control component that filters object detections based on their confidence scores.  It removes detections below a configurable threshold (`score`, default 0.5), improving precision at the cost of some recall.  Key parameters include `inclusive` (whether to include detections at the threshold) and `normalize_scores` (whether to normalize scores before filtering).  It's designed for various applications like surveillance, security, and medical imaging, offering different threshold recommendations for balancing precision and recall.  The policy is lightweight, fast (150,000 objects/second), and supports runtime updates.  It's intended to be placed in a processing pipeline after object detection but before more computationally expensive operations.  The document also provides configuration examples, threshold selection guidelines, integration instructions, and performance optimization tips.
