The Zone Filtering Policy (`pol-zone-filtering`) is a spatial filtering algorithm that uses Shapely and NumPy to determine if detected objects are within predefined polygonal zones.  It supports multiple intersection methods using configurable reference points (center, bottom_center, entire_box) and an intersection threshold (0.1-1.0, default 0.5).  Users can specify include and exclude lists for zones, and the zone polygons themselves are dynamically updatable via an API.  Performance is CPU-bound and scales with object, zone, and polygon vertex count (O(n×m×k)).  The policy requires Shapely and NumPy, a minimum of 300MB RAM, and is suitable for applications like area monitoring, perimeter security, and access control.  A table details scaling characteristics, showing increasing processing time with higher object, zone, and vertex counts.  The policy consumes and outputs OD1 format data, filtering the input `positioned_detections` based on the zone criteria to produce `filtered_detections`.
