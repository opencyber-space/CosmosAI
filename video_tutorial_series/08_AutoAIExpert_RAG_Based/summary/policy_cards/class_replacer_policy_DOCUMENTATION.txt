The Class Replacer Policy is a high-performance, lightweight Python component designed for efficient class label transformation in computer vision systems.  It replaces object class labels with new labels based on user-defined string mappings, offering exact or case-insensitive matching, configurable handling of unmapped classes (preserving, replacing with a default, or enforcing strict taxonomy), and bidirectional mapping support.  The policy boasts dynamic mapping updates with minimal latency and API integration for parameter control and status monitoring.  Highly efficient with O(1) lookup time and low resource consumption, it's suitable for high-throughput scenarios.  Key applications include model interoperability, domain adaptation (e.g., handling regional variations or aligning with industry standards), and taxonomy management (e.g., hierarchical mapping or class consolidation).  Configuration is via a list of string tuples defining original and replacement class names, along with options for case sensitivity and unmapped class behavior.
