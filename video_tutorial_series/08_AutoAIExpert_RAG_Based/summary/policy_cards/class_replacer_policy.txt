The Class Replacer Policy is a Python-based class transformation algorithm designed to standardize object class labels.  It replaces original class names with new ones based on user-defined mappings provided as a list of tuples.  The policy offers configurable case sensitivity, handling of unmapped classes (preservation or default replacement), and optional bidirectional mapping.  It's computationally lightweight (O(n) complexity), has a minimal memory footprint, and supports runtime updates to its parameters via API endpoints.  Benchmarks indicate high throughput and accuracy.  While supporting exact string matching only, the policy is crucial for model interoperability and domain adaptation, with ethical considerations regarding potential fairness impacts from class remapping.
