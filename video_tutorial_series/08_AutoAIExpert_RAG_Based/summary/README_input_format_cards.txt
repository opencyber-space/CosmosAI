Input Format Cards standardize data formats within computer vision pipelines, ensuring component compatibility and enabling automatic pipeline composition.  These cards define data structures, facilitate validation, and provide documentation.  Each card specifies component identity, schema definition, field details, extension support, compatibility mappings, validation rules, and performance characteristics.  The OD1 format exemplifies this, providing standard object representation.  Developers must declare input/output formats, validate fields, and handle extensions. Pipeline designers ensure format compatibility, plan data flow, optimize performance, and integrate validation. Best practices emphasize data integrity, performance optimization, and extensibility using the "props" field.  Integration with AIOS allows automatic component discovery, runtime validation, performance optimization, and documentation generation. Future extensions include support for diverse data types, version migration, schema evolution, and performance profiling.
