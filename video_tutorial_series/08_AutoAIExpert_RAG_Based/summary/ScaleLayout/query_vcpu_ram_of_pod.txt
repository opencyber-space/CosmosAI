This Python script collects CPU and memory usage metrics for Kubernetes pods and instance queue information, then exports the data to an Excel file. It uses the Kubernetes Python client and Prometheus API to fetch metrics, filtering pods by specified label selectors.  The script converts CPU usage to millicores and memory to gigabytes.  It retrieves instance queue data, events received per tick, and update time via a dedicated endpoint.  The update time is converted from UTC to IST if the system is in IST. Finally, the collected data is written to an Excel file, with each label selector getting its own sheet.
