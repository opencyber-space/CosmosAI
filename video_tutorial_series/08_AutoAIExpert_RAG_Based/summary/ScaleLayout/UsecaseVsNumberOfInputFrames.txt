This document provides a table for deployment planning, outlining the possible input FPS (frames per second) requirements for various video analytics use cases.  When multiple use cases are assigned to a single camera, the lowest overlapping FPS value among all assigned use cases should be used as the camera's FPS.  For example, if "Crowd Gathering" (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 FPS) and "Camera Tampering" (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 FPS) are both assigned, the camera FPS should be 1.  The FAQ section clarifies usage, emphasizing the importance of considering resource constraints and detection accuracy when selecting FPS values and addressing scenarios with no overlapping FPS values. Cameras in a set are not required to share the same FPS, but should be configured based on their assigned use cases.
