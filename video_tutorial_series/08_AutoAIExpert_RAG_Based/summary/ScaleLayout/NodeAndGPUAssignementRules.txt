This document provides guidelines for assigning sets (likely of data or processes) to nodes and GPUs in a distributed computing environment.  The key principle is to prioritize horizontal scaling: distribute sets with the same usecase across multiple servers and GPUs to improve fault tolerance and balance resource utilization.  Avoid overloading individual nodes or GPUs initially; instead, distribute sets evenly before stacking multiple sets on a single resource. This approach improves system stability, balances heat generation, and simplifies future scaling efforts.  The included FAQ reinforces these points and further emphasizes the importance of balanced resource distribution for performance and reliability.
