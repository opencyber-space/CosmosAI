This Python code monitors GPU usage and identifies the processes and Docker containers using them. It uses `nvidia-smi` to get GPU information like bus ID, index, memory usage, and process details (PID, name). It maps GPU bus IDs to indices for easier identification. The code then retrieves container IDs by parsing the `/proc/<pid>/cgroup` file for each process. Finally, it uses `docker ps` to get container names and short IDs, associating them with the full container IDs found earlier.  Error handling is implemented to manage cases where `nvidia-smi` or `docker` are unavailable, or when data parsing fails.  The code outputs lists of dictionaries containing process and container information.
