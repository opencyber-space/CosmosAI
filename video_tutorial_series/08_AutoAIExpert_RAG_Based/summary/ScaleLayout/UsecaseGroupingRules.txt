These guidelines outline best practices for grouping use cases in a video analytics deployment to optimize resource utilization, particularly on GPUs like the Tesla T4.  Usecases should be grouped based on similar FPS requirements and shared models. When grouping usecases with different FPS, use the lowest common FPS. Maximize camera count per group for better model utilization, but avoid adding usecases with new models for only a few cameras; create separate camera IDs (and thus GStreamer pipelines) instead, acknowledging the increased resource cost.  Consider resolution requirements, as higher resolutions may necessitate lower FPS.  For computationally intensive usecases like Chain Snatching or Fight Detection, a maximum of five cameras per GPU is recommended.  Lying and Leaning can be combined with these but may require a second pose model.  Always analyze hardware impact when dealing with custom usecase combinations.
