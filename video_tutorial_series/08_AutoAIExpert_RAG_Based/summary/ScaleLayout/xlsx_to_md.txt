This Python code reads data from each sheet of an Excel file (`pod_metrics.xlsx`) and converts them into separate Markdown files.  It creates a directory named `pod_metrics` if one doesn't exist, then iterates through each sheet of the Excel file. For every sheet, it reads the data into a Pandas DataFrame, creates a sanitized filename based on the sheet name, and saves the DataFrame as a Markdown table in the `pod_metrics` directory.  The Markdown files include a header corresponding to the original sheet name.
