This document provides example queries related to scaling and deploying AI video analytics workloads, specifically focusing on hardware resource planning and optimization using concepts like ScaleLayout and AppLayout.  The queries cover estimating hardware needs (GPU, CPU, RAM) for decoding video streams, understanding the impact of different parameters on model performance and resource utilization, and planning deployments across multiple nodes and GPUs.  They also address practical aspects like mapping cameras to use cases, creating sets for deployment, and optimizing for fault tolerance and resource utilization.  The document encourages users to phrase queries naturally using relevant terminology from the underlying `scalelayout.md` document.
