The tables show resource usage and event processing metrics for different pods, categorized into "general7Detection_360h_640" and "policy".  Both tables provide the `podname`, `cpu_data` (in millicores), `mem_data` (in GB), `instanceQueue` size, `eventsReceivedPerTick` (over 60 seconds), and the `updateTime`.  The "general7Detection_360h_640" pods generally consume more CPU and memory and process more events per tick compared to the "policy" pods.  One "general7Detection_360h_640" pod (block-4616c) has a non-zero instanceQueue size of 2.
