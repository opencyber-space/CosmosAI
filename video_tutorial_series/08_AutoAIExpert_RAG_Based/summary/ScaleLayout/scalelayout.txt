This document describes ScaleLayout, a crucial component in AIOS that defines the deployment strategy of AI models and pipelines onto hardware.  It complements AppLayout, which defines the pipeline structure of AI models, policies, and use case blocks.  Optimizing ScaleLayout is key for minimizing hardware resources by considering factors like model throughput, hardware utilization, and camera grouping.  The document emphasizes the importance of GStreamer, a library used for decoding video streams and feeding them into the AI pipeline.  A table illustrates the decoding capacity of different Nvidia GPUs for various codecs and resolutions, highlighting the relationship between hardware and the number of camera streams it can handle.  Ultimately, ScaleLayout and AppLayout enable efficient hardware evaluation and deployment planning for AI-based projects.
