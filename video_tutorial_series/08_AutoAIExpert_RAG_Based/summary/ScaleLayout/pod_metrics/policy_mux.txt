This table shows observed CPU and memory usage for the `policy_mux` block at different event rates per 60 seconds (`eventsReceivedPerTick`).  It's specifically designed for Scalelayout CPU and RAM estimations for this block and should not be used for other blocks.  The data includes `podname`, `cpu_data` (in millicores), `mem_data` (in GB), `instanceQueue` (which is 0 for all entries), `eventsReceivedPerTick`, `updateTime`, and a redundant "Block Usage Statement" summarizing the CPU and memory consumption at the given event rate.
