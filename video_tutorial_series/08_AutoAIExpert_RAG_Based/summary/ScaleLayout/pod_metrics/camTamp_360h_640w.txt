This table shows observed CPU (in millicores) and memory usage (in GB) for the `camTamp_360h_640w` block at different event rates (events received per 60 seconds).  It also includes the `podname`, `instanceQueue`, and the `updateTime` of the observation.  This data is specifically for resource estimation of the `camTamp_360h_640w` block and should not be generalized to other blocks.
