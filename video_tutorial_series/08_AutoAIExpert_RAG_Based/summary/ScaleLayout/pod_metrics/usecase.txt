This table shows observed CPU and memory usage for the "usecase" block at different event rates per minute (eventsReceivedPerTick).  It is specifically intended for estimating CPU and RAM scaling needs for this particular block.  The data includes the pod name, CPU usage in millicores, memory usage in GB, instance queue length (which is 0 in all observed cases), events received per minute, the time of the measurement, and a descriptive statement summarizing the block's resource consumption for that data point.
