This table shows observed CPU (in millicores) and memory usage (in GB) for the `custbodygend75` block at different event processing rates (eventsReceivedPerTick over 60 seconds).  It also includes the pod name, instance queue size, and the update time.  This data is specifically for estimating CPU and RAM requirements for the `custbodygend75` block and should not be generalized to other blocks.
