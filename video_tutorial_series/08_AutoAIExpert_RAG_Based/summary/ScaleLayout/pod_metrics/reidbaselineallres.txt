This table presents observed CPU and memory usage for the `reidbaselineallres` block at different event ingestion rates.  It shows `podname`, CPU usage in millicores, memory usage in GB, `instanceQueue` values, the number of events received per minute (`eventsReceivedPerTick`), and the update time.  Crucially, this data is specifically for `reidbaselineallres` and should only be used for scaling estimations for this block.
