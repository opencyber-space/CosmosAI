This table shows observed CPU (in millicores) and memory (in GB) usage for the `trackerlite` block at different event rates (events received per 60 seconds).  It's specifically designed for Scalelayout CPU and RAM estimations for this particular block and should not be used for other blocks.  Data includes the pod name, CPU and memory consumption, instance queue length (which is 0 in all observed cases), event rate, update time, and a descriptive statement summarizing the block's resource usage.
