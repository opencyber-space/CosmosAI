This table shows CPU and memory usage for the `general7Detection_360h_640` block at different event rates.  It lists `podname`, `cpu_data` (in millicores), `mem_data` (in GB), `instanceQueue`, `eventsReceivedPerTick` (over 60 seconds), `updateTime`, and a summary of these metrics for each block instance.  This data is specifically for scaling estimations of this particular block and should not be used for other blocks.
