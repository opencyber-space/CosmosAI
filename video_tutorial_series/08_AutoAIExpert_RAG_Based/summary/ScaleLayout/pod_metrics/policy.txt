This table shows observed CPU and memory usage for the `policy` block at different event rates, specifically `eventsReceivedPerTick(60seconds)`.  It's crucial to use this data *only* for estimating CPU and RAM Scalelayout requirements for the `policy` block.  The table lists `podname`, `cpu_data` (in millicores), `mem_data` (in GB), `instanceQueue` (which is 0 for all entries), `eventsReceivedPerTick(60seconds)`, `updateTime`, and a redundant "Block Summary" repeating the data in prose.
