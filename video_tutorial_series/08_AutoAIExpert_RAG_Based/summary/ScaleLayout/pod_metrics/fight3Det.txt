This table shows observed CPU and memory usage for the `fight3Det` block at different event ingestion rates.  It specifically correlates `eventsReceivedPerTick(60seconds)` with CPU usage (in millicores) and memory usage (in GB) for various instances of the block.  This data is intended for resource estimation for the `fight3Det` block only.  The `instanceQueue` value is consistently 0 across all observed instances. Data was collected around 06:35-06:36 UTC on June 24, 2025.
