This table presents CPU and memory usage data for the `firesmoke7Det_512h_896w` block, specifically for use in Scalelayout CPU and RAM estimations.  It shows observed `cpu_data` (in millicores) and `mem_data` (in GB) at different `eventsReceivedPerTick(60seconds)` rates, ranging from 120 to 500 events.  Data includes `podname`, `instanceQueue` (which is 0 for all entries), and `updateTime`.  It's crucial to use this data *only* for the specified block.
