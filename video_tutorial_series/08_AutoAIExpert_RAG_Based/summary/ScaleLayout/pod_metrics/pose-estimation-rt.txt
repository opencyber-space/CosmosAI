This table shows observed CPU (in millicores) and memory usage (in GB) for the `pose-estimation-rt` block at different event rates (events received per tick over 60 seconds).  It's specifically designed for estimating Scalelayout CPU and RAM requirements for this particular block and should not be used for other blocks.  The data also includes the pod name, instance queue, and the time of the measurement.
