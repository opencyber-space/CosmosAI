This table shows observed CPU and memory usage for the `usecase-frames` block at different event rates.  It should be used specifically for estimating CPU and RAM scaling requirements for this block based on the number of events received per minute (`eventsReceivedPerTick(60seconds)`), and not for other blocks.  The data includes the pod name, CPU usage in millicores, memory usage in GB, instance queue length, events received per minute, and a timestamp.  Each row represents a specific observation with a descriptive statement summarizing the block's resource consumption at a given event rate.
