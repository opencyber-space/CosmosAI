This table shows CPU and memory usage data for the `vehicles5Detection_360h_640` block, specifically designed for scaling estimations.  It records the `podname`, `cpu_data` (in millicores), `mem_data` (in GB), `instanceQueue`, `eventsReceivedPerTick` (every 60 seconds), and the `updateTime`.  The data demonstrates how CPU and memory consumption increases with the number of events received per tick.  Critically, this data is only applicable to the specified block.
