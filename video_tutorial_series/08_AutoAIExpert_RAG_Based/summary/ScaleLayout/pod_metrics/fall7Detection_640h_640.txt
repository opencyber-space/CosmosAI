This table shows CPU and memory usage for the `fall7Detection_640h_640` block at different event processing rates.  It specifically correlates observed CPU usage (in millicores) and memory usage (in GB) with the number of events received per 60-second tick (`eventsReceivedPerTick(60seconds)`).  The data also includes `podname`, `instanceQueue`, and `updateTime` for each observation.  This table should only be used for resource estimation of the `fall7Detection_640h_640` block.
