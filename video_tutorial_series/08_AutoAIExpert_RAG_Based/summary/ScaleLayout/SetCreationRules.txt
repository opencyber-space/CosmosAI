Sets are groups of cameras with similar use cases and FPS/model requirements used for deployment planning in Scalelayout.  Set creation is driven by a camera-usecase matrix and resource constraints.  The number of cameras in a set should not exceed GPU RAM (90-95%), GPU utility (60-80%), node vCPU (80%), and node RAM (90%).  Multiple sets can share a GPU if resources allow.  If a model's throughput is insufficient, create another instance within the set.  Components like Tracker, Policy, and Usecase can be shared across usecases.  Finally, `eventsReceivedPerTick(60seconds)` calculates the number of frames processed in 60 seconds: (number of cameras) * (FPS) * 60.
