This document describes a camera-to-usecase assignment matrix, used for planning camera deployments. The matrix maps cameras to use cases, with '1' indicating an assignment and '0' indicating no assignment.  It recommends an average of 2-3 use cases per camera, calculated using the formula: x*2 + (total_cameras - x)*3 = total_licenses, where 'x' represents cameras with 2 use cases. While 1 or 4 use cases per camera are permissible, exceeding 4 is discouraged unless absolutely necessary.  The matrix facilitates deployment planning and validation of camera-usecase assignments.
