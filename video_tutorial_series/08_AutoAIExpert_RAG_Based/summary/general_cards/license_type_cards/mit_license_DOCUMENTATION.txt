The MIT License is a permissive open-source license widely used in AI/ML, particularly computer vision, due to its adoption by frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.  It allows for commercial and non-commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use, requiring only that the original copyright and license text be included.  The license offers business-friendly terms with no royalties, required source disclosure, or reciprocal licensing, and it's compatible with other licenses like GPL and Apache 2.0.  Users must include the copyright notice and full license text in distributions.  The MIT License simplifies model deployment and component integration, posing minimal legal and compliance risks due to its clear terms and broad compatibility.  It's commonly used in various computer vision applications, from research code to commercial products like surveillance systems and automotive vision.
