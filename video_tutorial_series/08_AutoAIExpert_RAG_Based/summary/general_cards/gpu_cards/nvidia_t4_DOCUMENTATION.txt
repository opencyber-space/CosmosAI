The NVIDIA T4 is a Turing-architecture GPU optimized for inference workloads in data centers and cloud deployments.  Key features include 2,560 CUDA cores, 320 Tensor Cores, 16GB GDDR6 memory, and a 70W TDP.  It excels in INT8 (130 TOPS), FP16 (65 TFLOPS), and FP32 (8.1 TFLOPS) performance, demonstrating high efficiency for tasks like object detection (e.g., YOLOv8) and image classification (e.g., ResNet50).  The T4 is widely available in cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and supports popular deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX). While not ideal for training large models or double-precision compute, its strengths lie in inference, video processing, and computer vision applications, benefiting from optimization techniques like TensorRT and mixed precision.  Although lacking multi-instance GPU support, its low power consumption and competitive pricing make it a cost-effective solution for deploying AI inference at scale.
