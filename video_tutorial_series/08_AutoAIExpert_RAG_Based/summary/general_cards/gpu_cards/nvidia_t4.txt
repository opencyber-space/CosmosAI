The NVIDIA T4 is a Turing architecture GPU released in 2018, designed for inference, video processing, and computer vision tasks in cloud, data center, and edge server environments.  It features 2560 CUDA cores, 320 Tensor cores, and 16GB of GDDR6 memory.  It offers strong inference performance, achieving up to 130 INT8 TOPS and 65 FP16 TFLOPS, demonstrated by benchmark results on models like YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN.  The T4 is widely available on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) with an MSRP of $2299 and hourly cloud costs around $0.50-$0.75.  While power-efficient and compatible with major deep learning frameworks, it has limitations in training large models, lacks multi-instance GPU support, and requires TensorRT optimization for peak performance.
