This document outlines best practices for constructing computer vision (CV) pipelines.  It emphasizes starting with simpler models and iteratively increasing complexity, considering end-to-end latency over individual component speed, and matching resolutions across components.  Testing with representative data is crucial.  Common bottlenecks include pre-processing, data transfer, post-processing, and format conversions.  Optimization strategies include batching, precision reduction, pipeline parallelism, and stream processing.  Finally, the document recommends monitoring per-component latency, memory usage, accuracy metrics, and implementing heartbeat mechanisms.
