This document provides a quick reference guide for parameter tuning based on environmental conditions and specific use cases.  It utilizes a master configuration file (`MASTER_USECASE_PARAMETERS.md`) containing reusable parameter profiles that can be combined.  A quick reference matrix offers recommended Confidence, IoU, Resolution, FPS, and Tracking TTL values for various conditions like Low Light and High Accuracy.  Use-case specific JSON snippets provide pre-configured settings for security, safety, and behavioral analysis applications.  Further guidance is given for tuning confidence, IoU, and resolution, along with hardware resource planning considerations for GPU memory and processing speed.  Finally, troubleshooting tips are provided for common issues like high false positive/negative rates and performance problems, including suggestions for environmental adaptation based on lighting.
