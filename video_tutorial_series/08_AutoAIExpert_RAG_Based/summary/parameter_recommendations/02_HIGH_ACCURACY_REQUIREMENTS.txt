This document provides parameter recommendations for maximizing accuracy in computer vision pipelines for critical applications.  It prioritizes minimizing false positives/negatives and maximizing precision/recall, targeting >95% precision and >90% recall.  The document uses the `high_accuracy` base profile and adjusts specific parameters for various detection models (object, face, fire, weapon), tracking (general, FastMOT), processing (frame rate, image quality), and use cases (loitering, abandoned object, fall, fight, face recognition).  Key adjustments include higher confidence thresholds, stricter IoU values, larger model resolutions, longer track persistence, and conservative alert intervals.  Zone-based filtering is also configured for high precision with strict zone adherence.  All parameters are referenced against a master configuration file (`MASTER_USECASE_PARAMETERS.md`).
