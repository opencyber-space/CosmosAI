This document provides recommended parameter settings for various detection and tracking models to minimize false positives in scenarios where precision is paramount.  It prioritizes minimizing disruptive false alarms over potentially missing some true events.  The document offers specific JSON configurations for object, face, weapon, fire, and fall detection, emphasizing high confidence thresholds, stringent verification methods (like multi-frame confirmation, shape analysis, and contextual information), and conservative alerting intervals.  Tracking parameters are also tuned for high precision, using high IoU thresholds, stable tracking requirements, and strict association costs.  Processing parameters encourage stability through moderate FPS and temporal smoothing.  Finally, the document includes use-case specific adjustments for corporate and residential security, and automated systems, tailoring parameters like confidence thresholds and filtering options to the specific needs of each environment.
