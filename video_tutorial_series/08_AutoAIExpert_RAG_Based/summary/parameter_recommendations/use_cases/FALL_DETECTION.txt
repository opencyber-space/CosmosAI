This document provides recommended parameter settings for fall detection systems across various scenarios.  It categorizes these scenarios by environmental conditions (low light, high accuracy, wide area, false positive reduction) and camera placement (high, standard, and low mounting).  Each scenario includes specific values for parameters like confidence thresholds (for object, person, and fall detection), observation and recovery times, alert intervals, severity levels, frame rate, resolution, and trigger settings.  These adjustments optimize the system for different lighting, distances, required accuracy, and the likelihood of false alarms.  For example, low light conditions use lower confidence thresholds and longer observation times, while high accuracy settings prioritize higher confidence and faster response.  Camera height recommendations account for perspective distortion and detection challenges at different altitudes.
