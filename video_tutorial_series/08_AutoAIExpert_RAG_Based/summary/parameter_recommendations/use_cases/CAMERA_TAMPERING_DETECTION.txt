This document provides recommended parameter settings for camera tampering detection systems, categorized by building blocks (Tampering Detection, Video Processing, Alert Management, and System) and tailored for different environmental scenarios.  The core tampering detection parameters address scene changes, blur, brightness, and darkness.  Video processing parameters control resolution, batch size, and decoding method. Alert management dictates alert frequency and severity. System parameters manage frame rate and GPU usage.  Specific scenarios covered include: Indoor Surveillance (standard sensitivity), Outdoor Security Cameras (higher thresholds for variable lighting), Critical Infrastructure (maximum sensitivity and rapid response), and Low Light Environments (adjusted for low light conditions). Each scenario provides specific values for each parameter to optimize detection performance.
