This document provides recommended parameter settings for a chain snatching detection system using object detection and tracking.  It outlines different parameter sets optimized for various environmental conditions and camera placements.  These conditions include low light, high accuracy requirements, crowded areas, and wide area street monitoring.  Parameters are categorized into object detection (confidence, resolution, IoU, max detections), tracking (time-to-live, IoU weight, confidence bounds, minimum track length), and use case logic (alert interval, severity).  Additionally, the document offers parameter adjustments for different camera heights, including high-mounted, standard, and low-mounted positions, accounting for factors like perspective distortion and detection range.  Each scenario aims to balance detection sensitivity, accuracy, and computational efficiency.
