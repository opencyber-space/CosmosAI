This document provides recommended parameter settings for people line cross counting systems, categorized by environment, camera setup, and hardware.  It covers object detection parameters (confidence, IoU, image size), tracking parameters (time-to-live, IoU/height/location thresholds, minimum track length), line crossing specifics (zones, reference points), and system parameters (fps, GPU usage, batch size).  Recommendations are tailored for various scenarios like high-traffic areas (lower confidence, higher FPS), retail (medium persistence, precise location), offices (higher confidence, shorter persistence), and transportation gates (high confidence, short persistence, entry-point detection).  Camera height considerations adjust parameters for overhead, angled, eye-level, and panoramic views.  Finally, hardware-specific optimizations are provided for high-end, mid-range, and edge/CPU-only devices, adjusting batch size, FPS, and resolution to balance performance and accuracy.  Additional scenarios like event venues and healthcare facilities are also addressed with specific parameter tweaks.
