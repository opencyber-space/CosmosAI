This document provides recommended parameter settings for intrusion detection systems based on various use cases and hardware configurations.  It covers environmental conditions like low light, high accuracy needs, wide area coverage, and false positive reduction, each with specific settings for confidence, intersection over union (IoU), resolution, maximum detections, frames per second (fps), and alert intervals.  Camera height and positioning scenarios, from high-mounted to ground-level and PTZ cameras, also have tailored recommendations. Finally, the document offers optimizations for high-end and mid-range security systems, leveraging hardware like RTX 4090/A100 and GTX 1660 GPUs to maximize performance and accuracy.  The overall goal is to fine-tune intrusion detection parameters for optimal performance in diverse surveillance environments.
