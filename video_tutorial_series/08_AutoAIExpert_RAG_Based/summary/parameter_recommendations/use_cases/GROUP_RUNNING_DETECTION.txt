This document provides recommended parameter settings for a group running detection system, categorized by building blocks (Object Detection, Tracking, Group Analysis, Behavior Detection, Video Processing, and System) and tailored for various scenarios.  It details parameters like confidence thresholds, IoU, maximum detections, resolution, batch size, GPU usage, proximity thresholds, minimum and maximum group sizes, running speed thresholds, and frame rates.  Specific scenarios covered include sports venue monitoring, airport security, school campus safety, and mall/shopping center surveillance, each with adjusted parameters to optimize detection for the specific environment and security concerns, such as crowd density, required detection speed, and potential emergency situations.  The document aims to facilitate efficient RAG/Graph-RAG retrieval based on these optimized configurations.
