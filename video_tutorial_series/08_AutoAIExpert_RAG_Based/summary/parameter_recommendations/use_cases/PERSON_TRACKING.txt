This document provides recommended parameter settings for person tracking systems, categorized by environment, camera setup, and hardware capabilities.  Baseline parameters are provided, followed by adjustments for specific use cases like high-traffic areas (lower confidence, higher max detections, longer TTL), retail (higher confidence, moderate max detections), office spaces (higher confidence, lower max detections), and outdoor surveillance (higher confidence, higher resolution, longer TTL).  Camera height considerations include adjustments for perspective and occlusion at different mounting levels.  Hardware-specific optimizations are also detailed, scaling batch size, resolution, and FPS based on GPU capabilities or CPU-only limitations.  Finally, parameters are tuned for specific applications like security perimeter monitoring (high confidence, long TTL, precise location) and people counting (low confidence, high max detections).  The document aims to optimize person tracking performance and accuracy across a range of scenarios.
