This document provides recommended fire detection parameters for various scenarios.  It covers core object detection parameters (confidence, input size, IOU threshold, max detections), use-case specific parameters (alert interval, severity), and system parameters (FPS, batch size, hardware acceleration).  The document then details specific profiles for different environments: low light, high accuracy, outdoor forest fires, indoor environments, maximizing true positives (high sensitivity), and minimizing false positives.  Each profile adjusts parameters like confidence threshold, resolution, and processing speed to optimize for the specific use case. For example, low light conditions use lower confidence and higher resolution, while high accuracy scenarios prioritize higher confidence and resolution with slower processing.  Forest fire detection uses maximum resolution and lower FPS for distant detection.  True positive focus uses extremely low confidence to avoid missing any fire signs, while false positive reduction uses very high confidence.
