This document provides recommended parameter settings for a Face Recognition System (FRS) across various scenarios.  It categorizes these scenarios by environmental conditions (low light, high accuracy, wide area coverage, and false positive reduction) and camera height/positioning (high-mounted, standard height, eye-level, and angled).  Each scenario includes suggested values for parameters like confidence threshold (`conf`), minimum face height/width (`pixel_hthresh`/`pixel_wthresh`), intersection over union (`iou`), maximum detections (`max_dets`), distance threshold (`dist2d_threshold`), resolution (`width`/`height`), frames per second (`fps`), and severity level.  These parameters are tuned to optimize the FRS performance based on the specific challenges and requirements of each situation, such as low light visibility, the need for high accuracy, handling large crowds, minimizing false positives, and dealing with varying camera perspectives and angles.
