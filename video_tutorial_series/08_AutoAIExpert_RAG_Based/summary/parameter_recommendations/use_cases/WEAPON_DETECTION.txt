This document provides recommended parameter settings for weapon detection AI based on various environmental conditions and camera setups.  It covers low light, high accuracy, wide area coverage, and false positive reduction scenarios, adjusting parameters like confidence threshold (`conf`), non-maximum suppression (`nms_iou`), resolution (`width`, `height`), observation window (`window`), violation percentage, alert interval, severity, frames per second (`fps`), and hardware acceleration (`use_fp16`, `use_cuda`).  It also offers specific settings for different camera heights and angles, including high-mounted, standard height, eye-level, and angled cameras, further refining parameters based on the challenges of each perspective.  The goal is to optimize weapon detection performance and minimize false alarms across diverse surveillance situations.
