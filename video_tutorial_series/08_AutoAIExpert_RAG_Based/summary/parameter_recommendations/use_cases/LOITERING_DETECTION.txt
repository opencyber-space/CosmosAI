This document provides recommended parameter settings for loitering detection systems across various scenarios.  It outlines core parameters for object detection, tracking, and loitering logic, along with system parameters.  It then details specific profiles for four distinct use cases: 1) **Low Light Conditions:** prioritizing detection sensitivity over precision; 2) **High Accuracy Requirements:** maximizing precision for critical areas; 3) **Far Object Detection:** optimizing for small, distant objects; and 4) **Wide Area Monitoring:** balancing coverage and efficiency. Each profile adjusts parameters like confidence thresholds, resolution, processing speed, and alert severity to suit the specific environment and objective.
