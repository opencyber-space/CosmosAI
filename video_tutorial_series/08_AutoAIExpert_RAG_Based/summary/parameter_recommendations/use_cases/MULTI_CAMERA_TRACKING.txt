This document provides recommended parameter settings for multi-camera tracking systems, categorized by building blocks (Object Detection, Single-Camera Tracking, Cross-Camera Association, Multi-Camera Logic, Video Processing, and System Coordination) and tailored for specific environments (Airport, Shopping Mall, Campus, and Hospital).  Each building block focuses on a specific aspect of the tracking pipeline, from initial object detection to system-wide coordination.  The document then details environment-specific adjustments to these parameters, such as lowering the confidence threshold for object detection in crowded airport terminals or incorporating shopping behavior correlation in retail settings.  Example scenarios include optimized parameters for passenger tracking in airports, customer and security tracking in shopping malls, student tracking on campuses, and patient tracking in hospitals, each with adjustments to detection confidence, cross-camera association logic, and system coordination based on the specific needs of the environment.
