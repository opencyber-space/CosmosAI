This document provides recommended parameter settings for a parking violation detection system, categorized by environmental conditions and camera placement.  It covers object detection parameters (confidence, resolution, IoU, max detections), tracking parameters (time-to-live, IoU weight, confidence bounds, minimum track length), and use-case specific parameters (alert interval, severity).  Presets are provided for low light, high accuracy, busy, and wide area monitoring, as well as for high-mounted and standard camera placements.  These presets adjust parameters like confidence thresholds, resolution, and tracking aggressiveness to optimize performance in different scenarios. For example, low light conditions use lower confidence thresholds and higher resolutions, while high accuracy scenarios prioritize higher confidence and stricter IoU matching.  Camera height recommendations also influence parameters, with high-mounted cameras requiring lower confidence and more lenient tracking due to perspective distortion.
