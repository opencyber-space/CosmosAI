This document provides recommended parameter settings for social distance monitoring systems, categorized by building block (object detection, tracking, social distance specifics, and system), environment type, camera height, hardware capabilities, and specific industry scenarios.  Default parameters are provided, along with adjustments for high-density areas (lower confidence, higher detection limits, more lenient violation percentages), office environments (higher confidence, stricter enforcement), outdoor spaces (higher resolution, longer tracking persistence), and various camera heights (adjusting confidence, resolution, and height matching).  Hardware-specific optimizations are also included, scaling batch size, resolution, and frame rate based on GPU capabilities or CPU-only operation. Finally, the document offers tailored settings for healthcare (stricter enforcement, higher severity, faster alerts), education (longer observation windows, adjusted distances), and manufacturing environments.  The overall goal is to optimize the system's performance and accuracy across diverse scenarios.
