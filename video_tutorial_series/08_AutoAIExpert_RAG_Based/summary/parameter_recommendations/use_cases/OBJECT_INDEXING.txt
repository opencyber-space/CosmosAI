This document provides recommended parameter settings for object indexing systems across different use cases (Retail Inventory Management, Security Surveillance Indexing, and Industrial Quality Control).  It structures these recommendations by functional building blocks: Object Detection (confidence, IoU, max detections, image size), Classification (confidence thresholds, multi-label parameters, category hierarchy), Indexing Logic (persistence criteria, frequency, duplicate handling), Database Management (connection, optimization, retention), Video Processing (resolution, batch size, hardware acceleration), and System (fps, GPU usage).  Each use case section then specifies the relevant parameters and their suggested values, optimized for the specific application. For example, Retail emphasizes high resolution, continuous indexing, and product-specific optimizations; Security focuses on event-triggered indexing, forensic data integrity, and long retention; and Industrial Quality Control prioritizes high detection confidence, quality metrics, and batch correlation.
