This document provides recommended parameter settings for gesture waving detection systems, categorized by use case, camera height, and hardware capabilities.  Core parameters include pose detection settings (confidence, model type, resolution), gesture analysis settings (key points, movement thresholds, history length), and use-case-specific settings (wait time, alert frequency, severity).  Recommendations are provided for emergency/assistance, customer service, interactive applications, security/surveillance, and general scenarios.  Further adjustments are suggested for high, standard, low, and PTZ camera placements. Finally, optimizations for high-end GPUs are included.  The document aims to optimize gesture waving detection accuracy and performance across various applications and environments.
