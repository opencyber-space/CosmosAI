This document provides recommended parameter settings for face search systems, categorized by functional blocks (Face Detection, Face Recognition, Search Logic, and System) and tailored for six different environmental scenarios: High-Security Access Control, Surveillance and Monitoring, Retail Customer Recognition, Low Light Environments, Crowd Environments, and Outdoor Environments.  Each scenario emphasizes different performance priorities, adjusting parameters like confidence thresholds, minimum face size, similarity thresholds, encoding quality, search result limits, processing speed (fps), and GPU usage.  For example, High-Security scenarios prioritize high accuracy with stricter thresholds and slower processing, while Retail scenarios favor speed and broader detection.  The document aims to optimize RAG/Graph-RAG retrieval performance across diverse conditions and hardware setups.
