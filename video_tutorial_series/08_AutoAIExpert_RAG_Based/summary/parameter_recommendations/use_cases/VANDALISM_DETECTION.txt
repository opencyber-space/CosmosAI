This document provides recommended parameter settings for a vandalism detection system using pose and action recognition.  Core parameters include pose detection confidence, model type, and resolution; action detection type, specific actions (like "wave" or "throw"), key body points, and thresholds; and use-case parameters like group size thresholds, alert intervals, and severity levels.  System parameters cover frame rate, GPU usage, and batch size.  The document further tailors these parameters for specific environments like public parks, schools, transportation infrastructure, and private property, adjusting sensitivity and group thresholds as needed.  Finally, it offers recommendations for different camera heights and PTZ cameras, modifying parameters like confidence, key points, and thresholds to account for perspective and movement.
