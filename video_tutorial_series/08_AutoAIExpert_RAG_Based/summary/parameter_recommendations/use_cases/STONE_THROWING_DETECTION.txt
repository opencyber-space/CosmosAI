This document provides recommended parameter settings for a stone throwing detection system, categorized by environment, camera setup, and hardware capabilities.  The system uses pose detection to identify throwing motions and analyzes parameters like arm angles, the number of people involved, and the frequency of actions within specific time windows to trigger alerts.  Recommended parameters vary based on the specific use case. For instance, riot situations prioritize rapid response with lower thresholds and higher frame rates, while school environments use longer observation windows and moderate thresholds.  Camera height influences confidence levels and angle analysis, and hardware capabilities affect processing speed and resolution.  The document offers baseline parameters and then tailors them for different scenarios, emphasizing the balance between sensitivity, accuracy, and system performance.
