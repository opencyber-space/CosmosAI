This document provides recommended parameter settings for crowd gathering detection, categorized by environmental conditions and camera placement.  It covers object detection parameters (confidence, resolution, IoU, max detections), tracking parameters (time-to-live, IoU weight, confidence bounds, minimum track length), and use-case specific parameters (alert interval and severity).  Presets are provided for low light, high accuracy, large venue, and wide area monitoring, each adjusting parameters like confidence and maximum detections to suit the scenario.  Additional presets address camera height considerations, optimizing for high-mounted, standard event, and ground-level perspectives.  Each preset aims to balance detection sensitivity, accuracy, and resource usage for effective crowd monitoring and alert generation.
