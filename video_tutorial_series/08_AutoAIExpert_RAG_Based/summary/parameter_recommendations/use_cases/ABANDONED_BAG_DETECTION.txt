This document provides recommended parameter settings for abandoned bag detection systems, categorized by environmental conditions, camera placement, and hardware capabilities.  It covers object detection parameters (confidence, resolution, IoU, max detections), tracking parameters (time-to-live, IoU thresholds, minimum track length), and use-case specific parameters (alert interval, severity).  Presets are provided for low light, high accuracy, and crowded areas, each adjusting parameters like confidence and tracking persistence to suit the environment.  Camera height recommendations further refine these settings, accounting for perspective distortion and object clarity at different distances. Finally, hardware-specific optimizations suggest adjustments for high-end and mid-range systems, focusing on resolution, maximum detections, and leveraging hardware acceleration.
