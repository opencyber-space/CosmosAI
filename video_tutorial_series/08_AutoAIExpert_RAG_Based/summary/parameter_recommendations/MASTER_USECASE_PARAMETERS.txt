This document provides a comprehensive parameter configuration matrix for various computer vision use cases under different conditions.  It defines parameter sets for object, face, and specialized detection models (fire, weapon, and fall detection), including settings for confidence thresholds, model resolution, and batch size.  The document also specifies parameters for general and FastMOT tracking, such as time-to-live, intersection-over-union, and confidence thresholds. Finally, it includes use-case-specific parameters for loitering and crowd detection, defining thresholds for loitering time, crowd counts, and alert intervals.  These pre-defined parameter sets allow for easy configuration and optimization of computer vision models based on specific needs and environmental factors.
