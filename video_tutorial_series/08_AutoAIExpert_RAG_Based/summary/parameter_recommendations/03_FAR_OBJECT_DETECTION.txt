This document provides recommended parameter settings for computer vision pipelines aimed at long-range object detection (100m-1000m+), where objects appear small (10-50 pixels).  It uses the `far_detection` base profile and emphasizes high-resolution processing (1280x1280 or 1536x1536) with lower confidence thresholds to account for reduced visual information.  Specific adjustments are provided for object, face, fire, and weapon detection, often incorporating multi-frame confirmation, temporal analysis, and enhanced pre-processing. Tracking parameters are tuned for small, distant objects with longer track persistence, lower IoU thresholds, and higher uncertainty tolerances.  Processing parameters suggest lower frame rates (2/1 or 1/1) for computationally intensive tasks and utilize image sharpening and contrast enhancement. Finally, use-case specific adjustments are detailed for loitering, abandoned object, and intrusion detection, featuring increased thresholds, lenient matching criteria, and expanded zones to accommodate the challenges of long-range monitoring.
