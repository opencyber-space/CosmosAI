This document reports the 100% completion of parameter recommendations for 21 computer vision use cases.  The parameters, validated against source JSON files and organized by building blocks for optimal RAG/Graph-RAG retrieval, are now production-ready. Each use case (Loitering Detection, Fall Detection, Fire Detection, Weapon Detection, Face Recognition, Intrusion Detection, Abandoned Bag Detection, Chain Snatching Detection, Crowd Gathering Detection, Parking Violation Detection, Social Distance Monitoring, Person Tracking, Gesture Waving Detection, Vandalism Detection, Stone Throwing Detection, People Line Cross Counting, Camera Tampering Detection, Face Search, Group Running Detection, Object Indexing, and Multi-Camera Tracking) includes 10-15+ scenarios covering various environmental conditions and is documented with its status, building blocks, validated parameters, covered scenarios, and RAG-ready confirmation.
