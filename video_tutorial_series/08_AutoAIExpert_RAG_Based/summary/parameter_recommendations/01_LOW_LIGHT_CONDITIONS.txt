This document provides parameter recommendations for optimizing computer vision pipelines in low-light conditions (< 50 lux).  It focuses on adjusting detection, tracking, processing, and alert parameters based on a "low_light" base profile and referencing a master configuration file.  Key adjustments include lowering confidence and IoU thresholds, increasing maximum detections and track persistence, using higher model resolutions and FP32 precision, reducing batch sizes and frame rates, and increasing confirmation frame counts for various events like fire and weapon detection.  Specific use cases like loitering and abandoned object detection also have tailored adjustments, often increasing time thresholds and leniency.  Finally, the document suggests policy adjustments for zone and scale filtering, increasing alert intervals and enabling confidence reporting, and hardware optimizations like using DALI for decoding and reducing batch sizes for GPU stability.
