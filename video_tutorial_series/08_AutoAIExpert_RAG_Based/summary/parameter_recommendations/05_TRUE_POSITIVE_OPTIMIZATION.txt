This document provides recommended parameter settings for optimizing detection models and tracking algorithms to prioritize minimizing false negatives (maximizing recall), even at the cost of increased false positives.  It covers various detection tasks, including object, face, weapon, fire, and fall detection, emphasizing low confidence thresholds, high maximum detections, and aggressive tracking parameters.  The document also includes tracking parameters for high sensitivity and FastMOT in high recall mode, focusing on lenient association and low thresholds.  Processing parameters are geared towards high frequency and multi-model ensembles for enhanced sensitivity.  Finally, it offers use-case specific adjustments for security threat detection, safety monitoring, medical emergency detection, and intrusion detection, further tailoring the high-recall approach to each scenario.
