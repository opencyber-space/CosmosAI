This document provides recommended computer vision pipeline parameters for wide-area surveillance (10,000+ square meters) from elevated camera positions (10-50m).  It covers object detection (prioritizing high detection counts and moderate confidence), specialized models for crowds and vehicles, and face detection (allowing for smaller faces).  Regional processing configurations emphasize zone-based processing with varying FPS and resolution based on priority, and adaptive ROI management.  Tracking parameters are tuned for wide areas with moderate persistence and high capacity, including settings for MOT and FastMOT.  Processing optimization focuses on adaptive FPS based on activity and time, along with dynamic load balancing.  Finally, use-case specific adjustments are provided for crowd monitoring (density, flow, panic), vehicle monitoring (parking, traffic), perimeter security (intrusion, loitering), and behavior analysis (social distancing, queue management).  These parameters aim to balance detail with comprehensive coverage in challenging wide-area surveillance scenarios.
